But one group of researchers recently completed a landmark study pinpointing one of the primary catalysts for a common, debilitating mental condition: Scientists have determined that you may be at a high risk for depression if your life sucks.", "Wow! This is a truly groundbreaking discovery.\u00a0", "A team of clinical researchers at Harvard University recently completed a 10-year longitudinal study whose findings indicate that a given individual is much more likely to suffer from the hopelessness, lethargy, and frequent mood swings associated with major depression if their life sucks complete and utter ass. The team arrived at this conclusion following an ambitious, multi-year study observing the behaviors of individuals divided into two different test groups. Individuals in the first test group, or the \u201cAwesome Life Cohort,\u201d were provided with swanky high-rise apartments, meaningful, fulfilling jobs in their chosen fields, a large circle of devoted friends and lovers, and unlimited money. Conversely, individuals in the second test group, or the \u201cShitty Life Cohort,\u201d\u00a0 were forced to live in filthy, dilapidated basement apartments and spend 12 hours a day working in solitary, dead-end temp jobs, all while regularly being reminded that their peers and family members thought of them as huge losers.", "The results were astonishing: After just one year, members of the Shitty Life Cohort were 10 times more likely than the Awesome Life Cohort to report thoughts such as \u201cI feel sad that I live in a nasty rat hole,\u201d and \u201cThe fact that I do the exact same boring activities every day of my life with zero acknowledgment or positive reinforcement from my family or peers makes me unhappy.\u201d Whereas members of the Awesome Life Cohort were exponentially more likely to report thoughts such as \u201cI feel fantastic all the time\u201d and \u201cI have no complaints about my life because everything is perfect.\u201d", "\u201cThe bottom line is, the longer you endure what the average American would consider an absolute trash dump of an existence, the more likely you are to suffer from depression\u2014and conversely, leading an epic life of luxury where the adventures never stop is protective against the low moods associated with depression,\u201d explained lead researcher Dr. Timothy McDougall. \u201cThere are clear short-term implications of having a shitty life as well: in another experiment, we found that members of a group who we punched in the stomach were highly likely to frown or cry as a result (two common depression indicators), while members of a second group to whom we gave $50 Starbucks gift cards were much more inclined to smile and even hum a happy tune. The evidence clearly suggests a higher probability of debilitating mental health disorders for those whose lives are total ass and full of misery and woe.\u201d", "McDougall and his research team said that their study has profound implications for the treatment of depression. Future therapies could include taking a whirlwind, all-expenses-paid trip to the hottest tourist destinations around the globe, receiving 10 million dollars, or even winning the love and admiration of people around the world via a project that is both personally fulfilling and incredibly altruistic.", "How fascinating! We truly have so much to learn about psychology and the human brain, and these amazing new insights will undoubtedly have impacts on the field for years to come. Kudos to these extraordinary scientists for doing such important work to demystify an illness that affects so many millions of people every day. "]},

After throwing up devil horns to the camera, Ozzy put the front seat in a headlock like it was gonna try to run away, dramatically lowered his teeth toward it like a vampire, and began just kind of gnawing and slurping on the headrest for a while. To see the rock legend futilely slobbering all over a car seat for hours on end has been a pretty big bummer, and sadly he\u2019s still going at it despite getting no closer to his goal of biting off the headrest than when he started. Soaked in sweat and gasping for air with his eyeliner dripping down his face, you gotta imagine that this isn\u2019t what he envisioned when he kicked off the stunt.\u00a0", "Oof.

If I may though, I would like to steer the conversation back around to what wind is.", "In the weeks since Biles made her brave announcement, we\u2019ve been engaged in a productive national discussion about mental health and how it relates to our broader cultural conception of \u201csuccess,\u201d which is a huge step forward for us all\u2014in no way am I trying to detract from that. But it just so happened to come right as I\u2019d been contemplating on the mysterious force that is wind, and I\u2019d love to circle back on that now that we\u2019ve made some headway on the mental health thing. In my own research, I\u2019ve determined that it\u2019s very possible that wind could simply be the sensation of dinosaur ghosts flying around as they eternally wander the Earth due to their souls not being allowed in either heaven or hell. Now, in the interest of full transparency, this theory doesn\u2019t quite explain why we can feel wind on holy ground like churches or graveyards, but it definitely merits further discussion.\u00a0", "Just as recently as a month ago, few outside the gymnastics world had ever heard of the \u201ctwisties,\u201d much less considered how dangerous such a loss of spatial orientation could make the sport for athletes so afflicted, and now that we\u2019re all caught it up it feels reasonable for me to redirect our discussion towards another wind theory of mine, which is whether wind causes or is caused by the majestic waving of American flags. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re correlated somehow, but it\u2019s been too much of a chicken-and-the-egg scenario for me to make sense of alone with everyone else talking about the crushing weight of expectation our society places on young athletes. In the past, public dialogue has helped move me away from a similar thesis that wind is generated by birds flapping their wings, but I see way more flags than birds these days and they\u2019re also almost always bigger, so I\u2019d really appreciate hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts if people are cool switching the topic now.", "I certainly don\u2019t need to give any more airtime to critics\u2019 arguments that Biles\u2019 decision was \u201cselfish\u201d or \u201centitled,\u201d in part because they\u2019re disingenuous and rooted in the toxic assumption that athletes exist only to serve our desire for entertainment, and in part because I have a theory about wind coming from a single, colossal Antarctic fan built by ancient Atlanteans that I\u2019m really dying to bounce off of everybody while it\u2019s still fresh in my mind. You saw a similar kind of backlash after Naomi Osaka\u2019s decision to withdraw from the French Open, though I\u2019m fully willing to admit that I steamrolled ahead with my \u201cwind is what happens when God lets out a sigh\u201d idea too forcefully for a national discussion of mental health to get going back then. I derailed that one, and Simone Biles derailed me in turn. Seems like we\u2019re square now, so how about we get back on track by spitballing some ideas about whether regular air is just wind that has died and become inert or if it is wind that is merely resting in place.", "Future generations will no doubt hail Simone Biles as the GOAT for both her dominant athleticism and her bold mental health advocacy, but I\u2019d hate for her to also be remembered as the reason we still don\u2019t know what the hell is going on with wind. Let\u2019s put a pin in the mental health stuff for now and come back later, because I\u2019m pretty sure just a bit more discussion about wind could finally bust this thing wide open.\u00a0"]},

It\u2019s about time someone developed specific treatments for the bewildering hodge-podge of skin types that are found in the groin area.\u00a0", "Earlier this week, Aveeno unveiled its new Down There line of products, with seven unique lotions designed to replenish and restore the fleshy pandemonium that is the human crotch, providing targeted treatment for the chaotic clusterfuck of skin textures that exist in and around the groin. Though a person\u2019s skin is technically considered one single organ, Aveeno is betting big on consumers realizing that the lotion one uses for, say, the normal-looking skin on their torsos is not sufficient for addressing the myriad needs of the bafflingly piecemeal flesh that makes up one\u2019s genitals, whether it\u2019s the smooth, reddish skin of the penis tip, the wacky dermal topography of the vagina, or the shriveled, leathery quagmire that is the scrotum.

The Aveeno Down There line has a moisturizer for every type of groin skin, whether the translucent-when-stretched skin of the scrotum, the rubbery little ring of flesh that separates the shaft from the penis, or any other kind of skin you might encounter below the waist.\u201d", "\u201cSimply put, if you point to anywhere on or around the genitals\u2014whether it\u2019s bits of skin that look like they fell off and got chewed up by a dog before getting poorly glued back on, testicle skin that got a little nicked up because you\u2019re still shaving with the same $20 electric trimmer you bought in high school, or literally anything in the vicinity of the vagina lips\u2014Aveeno has you covered,\u201d the statement continued.\u00a0", "So cool!", "These new lotions are sure to be a total game-changer for anyone who\u2019s either been putting standard body lotion on their junk every now and then when it feels kind of dry or has basically just been ignoring their groin skincare-wise this whole time, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before other skincare brands start releasing genital skin moisturizers of their own.

Since then, there\u2019s not been a single official record of a witch being taken into custody anywhere throughout the United States, let alone executed for their crimes against God and their devotion to carrying out Satan\u2019s will. Data suggests that public stigma has deterred local and federal law enforcement from pursuing witchcraft practitioners, with fewer than three percent of U.S. police departments allocating any budget whatsoever to defending citizens against the demonic behaviors and heresies of witches.

Unfortunately, because no witches have been caught since 1693, we have zero data on witch-related crimes, or how many may have gotten away with child-stealing, performing love charms, casting spirits of madness unto livestock, or rendering innocent virgins deaf as a result of lax anti-witchcraft policies.\u201d\u00a0", "Absolutely disturbing.

But, troublingly, hardly any police departments are taking even the most basic, no-brainer precautions such performing exorcisms on mute children or touching crucifixes to crooked-nosed wretches to see if they burst into flames, leaving the American people alarmingly susceptible to spells and curses of all kinds.\u00a0", "The implications here are unsettling, to say the least. It is possible, if not probable, that Satan Himself may be corrupting hundreds of new women every day, tempting them into lives of blasphemy and promiscuity in exchange for signing away their souls in His Ledger, without any fear of police reprisal. To see an animal in the woods and know it very well could be a witch who has shifted shapes, or the conjured spirit of an occultist\u2019s familiar, is downright harrowing.

What this means for Yellowstone\u2019s broader ecosystem remains to be seen, but at the current rate of climate shift, it\u2019s very possible that every animal species in the park could be facing the wrong direction in less than 50 years. And if that doesn\u2019t scare you, consider that the problems these bison are facing now will eventually impact humans\u2014children born facing right today will grow up in a world that increasingly forces them to face left, obliterating life as we\u2019ve known it for all of human history.\u201d", "Absolutely terrifying.

While plenty of kids would absolutely kill to have such an awesomely dedicated dad, having Dave as a positive role model in their lives is apparently doing jackshit for these doughy, boring twins who somehow manage to be terrible at things that even kids with deadbeat dads are pretty good at, like building stuff with Legos and drawing cool pictures of trucks.", "It\u2019s soul-crushing to see a man putting so much effort into hands-on, loving parenting and having his kids still end up being a couple of unpopular dipshits who spend their time playing lame grandma games like Farmville on their phones and frequently have to go to the doctor for dumb shit like ear infections and skin tags. Had Dave spent even half the time he\u2019s spent being there for his practically worthless kids on managing his investment portfolio or practicing his golf game or something, he would probably be so much farther in life. As it stands, however, his dedication to raising his kids right hasn\u2019t netted any sort of tangible return, as neither one has produced a single trophy, gotten the lead role in a play, or successfully caught a fish.

With his sons\u2019 most impressionable years behind them, every additional day he spends being the best father he can is sadly just wasted effort, and at this point, it\u2019d be foolish for him to hope for more. It\u2019s plainly evident these boys will only continue to suck more and more as they go through puberty, and no amount of unconditional love will divert them from the path of sucking super bad they\u2019re already on.

It just goes to show that, if you set your mind to it, it\u2019s never too late in life to become really bad at something.\u00a0", "We really have to hand it to Mom for having the passion and determination to wake up every day and solve Sudoku puzzles at what can only be described as a glacially slow pace. As far as being shitty at Sudoku goes, she is truly on pace to smash all-time records, and we could not be more proud. Amazing job, Mom! It\u2019s awesome that you have a nice activity now to help pass the time as you navigate your slow, inescapable descent into senility. "]},

With the public suddenly deprived of their sole source of mute, expressionless alien guys drumming on PVC pipes and blasting audiences with toilet paper launched from modified leaf blowers, desperation has truly taken its toll\u2014in April 2021 alone, over 4,000 suicides were reported in areas across the country where the Blue Man Group has stopped performing, with some localities declaring the lack of access to the Blue Men\u2019s signature high-energy percussion-based comedy an official state of emergency.\u00a0", "Middle-class Caucasians appear to be especially suffering from the lack of Blue Man Group access, as the concerts have long represented a peak cultural experience for white suburban families, who often travel to big cities to enjoy the Group\u2019s funky yet accessible rhythms and family friendly antics after long days of sightseeing and dining at Hard Rock Cafes. In one particularly disturbing case, a white family of five in New Jersey committed group suicide by funneling carbon monoxide from their Subaru Outback\u2019s exhaust pipe into their home while they sat on their living room couch watching the Blue Man Group\u2019s Tiny Desk concert on TV.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u201cUnfortunately, our country\u2019s mental health system just isn\u2019t equipped to handle this sudden surge of millions of Americans who are struggling to cope in a world where they can\u2019t watch three bald, blue men splash neon paint on stage in various amusing ways,\u201d said NIMH researcher Emmitt White. \u201cNot only are Blue Man Group performances fun, but they also have a lot of heart, which makes for a truly unforgettable concert experience that we\u2019re now seeing that some people just cannot live without. Human brains simply aren\u2019t wired to handle this isolation from drum- and paint-based performance art.\u201d\u00a0", "White went on to note that, while virtual concerts might offer a temporary solution in the meantime until U.S. society can safely reopen, they unfortunately cannot fully recreate the laughter, joy, and wonder of watching wide-eyed blue guys banging on a drumbone in-person.\u00a0", "Heartbreaking. Let\u2019s pray America reaches herd immunity soon, because it\u2019s clear people can\u2019t handle this Blue Man Group deprivation for much longer.\u00a0", "With the end of the pandemic so close in sight, it\u2019s difficult but necessary for us to reflect on the far-reaching impacts it has had on ourselves and our communities around us. It\u2019s safe to say that once the pandemic lets up, people won\u2019t take the Blue Man Group for granted again. But until then, please look after yourselves and others, and remember that we\u2019re all in this together."]},

I liked her as soon as I met her\u2014she\u2019s a no-nonsense woman, and she made me feel calm and at ease during my checkup. The appointment was perfectly normal: she asked me about my cycle, gave me a routine pelvic exam, and refilled my birth control prescription. There\u2019s always a bit of awkwardness when you\u2019re lying uncomfortably on the exam table with your feet in the stirrups, but other than that, everything seemed fine. Anyways, when I got home, I googled Dr. McNeill out of curiosity and ended up on her Facebook page, where, not ten minutes after our appointment ended, she had posted a pixelated picture of a sunset with the caption \u201cThere\u2019s beauty in the breakdown.\u201d I didn\u2019t think much of it until I noticed that a friend of hers had commented \u201cYou ok?\u201d and she had responded \u201cNot rly. Hate being a doctor.\u201d The thing was, I know for a fact that I was her only appointment of the day. She made a point to tell me that.

Needless to say, I was definitely a little concerned.", "I was back at Dr. McNeill\u2019s office three months later for a checkup because my pap smear had come back abnormal, and I was sure it wasn\u2019t going to be a repeat of the time before, Facebook-wise. I made sure to shower, wear my best underwear, and even floss my teeth in case that was something she had an issue with last time. Again, the appointment seemed totally routine. But I did notice her grab her iPad as soon as I started packing up to leave the exam room, and when I tried to say bye to her, she just sort of grunted and then shut the door in my face. Lo and behold, there was a post on her Facebook not two minutes later featuring an extremely similar sunset picture to the first one. She had marked her mood as \u201cfeeling hopeless\u201d and finished off the post with a melodramatic caption of \u201cSend positive vibes :(. Need to quit my job YESTERDAY.\u201d\u00a0 I had no idea what to think of this. In a panic, I tried googling a few search terms like \u201cupsetting vagina\u201d and \u201cmy cervix made doctor mad,\u201d but nothing came up. Regardless, something about me clearly rubbed her the wrong way.", "The next time I went to Dr. McNeil was to discuss getting an IUD, and after that visit, she made not one but TWO posts on her Facebook page that were very obviously referring to our appointment. It was the kind of checkup where I didn\u2019t even have to take my clothes off or anything, but as soon as I walked in, she visibly recoiled, and seemed shaken for a good 30 seconds before she took a deep breath and handed me some birth control pamphlets. When I checked later, she had gone on Facebook and posted\u00a0 an image of a cliff overlaid with the words \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not be okay,\u201d and then, only three minutes later, a dramatic, shadowy selfie, clearly taken in the same room where our appointment had just happened, with the caption \u201cWhen a patient pushes you to the brink, all you can do is push back.\u201d There\u2019s just no way the patient she was referencing wasn\u2019t me, but I have no clue what the fuck drove her to feel that way. Mind you, all the rest of her Facebook posts are pictures of her kids\u2019 sports games and her two golden retrievers.", "When I had to come in again for a full exam, I made sure to go all out, because I was beginning to get tired of this Facebook drama. I bought Dr. McNeill a nice box of fancy chocolates from Whole Foods, and she accepted it with what seemed like genuine enthusiasm. Then, she got me in the stirrups, and told me everything looked \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cperfectly healthy.\u201d The only weird moment was one part where she took a look around with the speculum, paused for a long time, then said \u201cHmmm\u201d and sort of sighed. When I asked her if something was wrong, she didn\u2019t even answer me\u2014she just looked out the window for a while, shook her head, and got back to the exam. After I left the office, she posted \u201cTHE COMPANY OF WOLVES IS BETTER THAN THE COMPANY OF A WOLF IN SHEEP\u2019S CLOTHING\u201d in all caps with a picture of that day\u2019s sunset that she took herself on her iPhone. I swear to god, there\u2019s nothing that weird about my vaginal health as far as I can tell. I do not know why she feels the way she does about me.", "At my most recent appointment, I decided I might try to bait Dr. McNeill into explaining what was going on, so I started complaining about how my aunts and uncles won\u2019t stop posting conspiracy theory memes to their Facebook timelines. Without skipping a beat, she simply answered, \u201cWell, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have Facebook,\u201d and smiled. She straight-up acted as though she didn\u2019t even have a Facebook page, when I knew full well she would be posting about me on it the second after I left. I paid careful attention during the entire exam, even that weird part where she sort of feels at your ovaries from the inside and lets you know if she thinks you have any cysts. She didn\u2019t exactly seem ecstatic, but I don\u2019t think my ovaries were fucked up enough to warrant the post she made that afternoon, which featured an image of the Grim Reaper overlaid on the picture of me that the front desk took when I first started seeing Dr. McNeill. She must have made the graphic herself. On top of the picture, there was stylized text reading, \u201cOnly after you have looked death in the face can you truly live.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what the fuck I need to do before my next appointment to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again, but rest assured I will be trying to figure it out.

Sadly, no matter how slick of a flip-flop paint job his ride has or how clean his whitewall tires are, every now and then Grandpa gets totally upstaged by Batman. Here are 5 times Batman made Grandpa feel like a worthless piece of shit by bringing the Batmobile to his classic car meetup in the parking lot of Red Robin.", "In this instance, Grandpa was grinning ear-to-ear with his thin hair slicked back and his airbrushed Mopar Legends shirt neatly tucked into his oversized cargo shorts as he popped the hood of his cherry \u201870 Dodge Challenger.

But just as he was telling her the story about how he tracked down a period-correct blower \u201cin Japan of all places,\u201d the Batmobile suddenly appeared and exploded spectacularly, and from the flaming wreckage, Batman emerged on an awesome motorcycle and popped a wheelie, eliciting a squeal of delight from Doris. \u201cHey, old timer,\u201d Batman shouted to Grandpa. \u201cYour car looks stupid as shit and you look like a shriveled ballsack with eyes.\u201d He then winked at Doris and peeled off on his motorcycle, causing Grandpa turned beet red with embarrassment.

Drenched in Aqua Velva and ready to swap everything from rare carburetors to old jukeboxes, they planned to rev their engines all the way until 9 PM when the Red Robin closed up for the night. The event is basically like the Super Bowl for my Grandpa, and this time things were going great for him pretty much all day.

However, just as he went up to accept his ribbon from local radio personality Z-Bone of 101.3 The Zoom, who was emceeing the event, the Batmobile roared into the Red Robin parking lot and sprayed Grandpa head to toe with oil, much of which also splattered all over his ride\u2019s paint job. The 17 people in attendance were thrilled by this unexpected cameo and began chanting \u201cBAT-MO-BILE! BAT-MO-BILE!\u201d\u2014completely ignoring Grandpa and his special moment.

Not only could Grandpa have used that $300,000 to help cover his rising medical expenses, but he lost the bragging rights of having sold a car to a celebrity.

Grandpa had just mounted a new set of slicks in the back and tuned up the engine, so the Porsche was running hotter than ever, but just as he was strapping on his driving goggles to run the first grandkid around the block, Batman pulled up in the Batmobile, launched himself 600 feet into the air in the ejector seat, and turned to the line of kids and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d upon landing. Needless to say, the grandkids weren\u2019t exactly itching at that point to strap into the Porsche, and suddenly Grandpa was left standing all alone, watching Batman show his grandkids the time of their lives.

Hell, I\u2019ll even play along with it. I actually just bought a Mickey Mouse mascot costume without the head on eBay, and I\u2019m going to surprise her and put it on later tonight.

Astronomers around the world have long warned us of the extinction-level dangers posed by asteroids, but never have they urged people to curb incestuous behavior to mitigate the risk. Even Hollywood, with all of its far-fetched imagination, has yet to produce a Sci-Fi film about a team of scientists who must stop an aunt and her nephew from making love at a Ramada Inn before they summon an asteroid that destroys the planet.

Just saying, nowhere on a 1040 form does it ask if the family members you\u2019re claiming as dependents are sleeping with one another. You think the IRS cares about your son\u2019s Oedipus complex? You think you\u2019re going to get less money back if you file jointly with the uncle you married? It goes to show that there are some select things that incest has no negative impact on whatsoever."]},

This is so empowering\u2014we have no choice but to stan!", "This morning, 28-year-old Rosie Brecker of Austin, Texas boldly stepped out of her house in a full face of makeup, which may seem like an attempt to conform to typical beauty standards, but is actually a super subversive, anti-beauty-culture act given that every time she puts makeup on it looks completely fucking awful. Despite living in an appearance-obsessed culture her entire life, Rosie somehow never quite figured out how liquid eyeliner works or what blush is really supposed to do, and now, every time she tries to do a clumsy cat-eye look or applies the too-bright lipstick she thinks gives her a sort of child-pageant-contestant vibe, it takes all the inner strength and confidence she has to step out in public and strut her stuff. Rosie knows for a fact that putting $150 worth of products from Sephora on her face makes her look at best like a confused preteen and at worst insane, but she is bravely sticking it to the patriarchy by looking god-awful in her makeup anyway!", "Go Rosie!", "Some women feel pressure to put on foundation, mascara, and lip gloss every single day just so they can hide their imperfections and look \u201cgood enough\u201d to show their faces in public, but not Rosie.

Yes, it makes me feel vulnerable to go out in public with blush that goes all the way up to my temples because I think I saw that in a magazine one time, but sometimes, a little vulnerability is better than a lot of perfection. So don\u2019t be afraid to wear makeup, even if you\u2019re a complete fucking idiot at it like I am.\u201d", "Yes! Posting an awkward selfie of herself in almost clown-like makeup is actually far more impressive than any celebrity\u2019s no-makeup pic, because the sheer lack of skill with which Rosie applied her new highlighter stick is a true slap in the face to the idea that women need to look flawless at all times. Rosie looks like straight-up garbage right now, and she is getting out there and taking up space like the messed-up eyeshadow queen she is. Get it, girl!", "Yep, this is giving us the confidence boost we need to get through the day. It\u2019s so awesome to see a woman wearing bad makeup in a society that tells her every day that she can\u2019t!

Everyone loves him so much, but if he keeps recklessly pile-driving into shallow pools of water, sooner or later he\u2019s going to get himself killed.", "There were endless possibilities during the hotel pool boom of the early 1990s. People were doing a lot of exciting, innovative stuff in hot tubs, but no one was doing it better than Jacuzzi Phil. However, his diving career nearly came to an end at a Holiday Inn 30 years ago. As dozens of young movers and shakers partied around the hotel\u2019s indoor pool, sipping screwdrivers and making sexually inappropriate jokes, Jacuzzi Phil suddenly burst into the room, kicked off his penny loafers, and shouted out his famous catchphrase, \u201cI am doing it again!\u201d to which the adoring crowd, as always, responded, \u201cHe\u2019s hot for tubbin\u2019!\u201d But then things turned scary.\u00a0\u00a0", "Jacuzzi Phil dove, noggin first, right into the hot tub.

The doctors said had he not been incorrectly wearing his scuba mask on the top of his forehead, thus absorbing much of the impact, he would\u2019ve died.\u00a0", "For many years after the Holiday Inn incident, Jacuzzi Phil continued diving head first into hot tubs all over the United States and Eastern Europe without incident.

That night, Jacuzzi Phil stepped out onto the balcony overlooking the palm tree-shaped pool and shouted \u201cI am doing it again!\u201d to a crowd of cheering onlookers, to which they dutifully replied \u201cHe\u2019s hot for tubbin\u2019!\u201d while hooting and hollering and slapping their thighs. Then Jacuzzi Phil jumped down into the hot tub, and moments later a collective gasp of horror went through the crowd as a pool of dark blood began to form around their hero\u2019s limp neck.

The doctors had to put him into an induced coma for four months while they waited for the pressure and fluid to drain. His spleen was also removed, although this procedure was elective. ", "Though jacuzzi culture waned in popularity in the new millennium, Jacuzzi Phil never gave up on his passion. He continued diving into hot tubs, though no longer for crowds of cheering onlookers, as the internet and its myriad thrills had largely rendered jacuzzi-based entertainment obsolete in the eyes of the American public.", "One August morning in 2011, he plummeted head first into the jacuzzi at the Red Roof Inn he\u2019d been living at for about a year. When he arrived at the hospital, they discovered his emergency contact was the Red Roof Inn\u2019s front desk receptionist. Phil suffered multiple contusions and fractures and practically split his vertebrae in two. After 13 months of observation (it would\u2019ve only been two months had he not botched a dive into a hospital therapy pool during recovery), Phil left the ICU with dementia pugilistica.", "In an ambitious effort to generate some buzz and attract a new generation of fans to the sport of hot tub diving, Jacuzzi Phil staged a death-defying, fanfare-filled dive from a 50-foot platform into a small hot tub he\u2019d erected on the plaza of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, marketing the stunt as \u201can artistic interpretation of the famous antics of the 9/11 Falling Man.\u201d As always, he preceded his jump by shouting \u201cI am doing it again!\u201d but only a few onlookers knew to shout \u201cHe\u2019s hot for tubbin\u2019!\u201d in response. Then he jumped, at which point the spectacle took a grotesque turn.\u00a0", "Jacuzzi Phil crushed his frontal lobe and nasal cavity. Then he got up, broken head and all, and took a bow before collapsing into the nearby reflecting pool, at which point security arrived to escort his limp, unconscious body from the premises. In the weeks that followed, specialists would remove significant portions of tissue near the brainstem. One of his doctors said his brain scan looked like a decomposing rat.", "Jacuzzi Phil has not yet recovered enough from his injuries to start diving again, and friends and family are hoping that this most recent life-threatening accident will be what finally convinces him to retire. But in reality, asking Jacuzzi Phil to stop diving into jacuzzis would be like asking Tony the Tiger to stop yelling about Frosted Flakes\u2014it\u2019s his entire identity, and if you take that away, then he has nothing. Still, considering that he can\u2019t even shout his famous catchphrase now without slurring his words due to the multiple compressive cranial neuropathies he\u2019s suffered, it\u2019s clear that things aren\u2019t going to get any better for him.

{"headline": [], "article": ["The more we learn about nature, the more incredible it gets, and a groundbreaking new discovery about avian flight is truly blowing our minds: Researchers have determined that birds can still fly if you zip a bunch of them up inside a duffel bag.", "Incredible!", "According to the bombshell study published yesterday in the academic journal ", "Science", ", birds zipped up inside of a medium-to-large-sized duffel bag generally retain enough of their capacity for flight to propel the duffel bag as much as three feet off the ground, and are further able to slowly fly the bag around a small area for hours at a time. The study details how researchers initially expected their tests to demonstrate that being stuffed into a duffel bag completely negates birds\u2019 ability to fly, but were stunned to find that eight seagulls crammed in a closed duffel bag were able to raise the bag to waist-height and hover across the laboratory before setting themselves down on an empty chair. And while the seagulls exhibited significant reductions in speed and maneuverability while jammed in the duffel bag, mostly just lurching around aimlessly and crashing into obstacles, they were nonetheless able to reliably achieve liftoff pretty much any time the scientists loudly blew whistles at them to frighten them into flapping their wings.\u00a0", "\u201cObviously you can\u2019t do studies on this scale without losing some birds to things like asphyxiation or panic-induced frenzies of bird-on-bird disembowelment, but thanks to generous funding from the aerospace sector, we never had any shortage of specimens to aid us in conducting this vital research,\u201d said Yale\u2019s Dr. Elizabeth Ballentine, the lead researcher behind this incredible discovery. \u201cThis patronage has allowed us to indulge our every curiosity: What happens if we knock the duffel bag around with hockey sticks during flight? Could zipping a predator such as a fox or snake in with the birds motivate them to fly higher? Will the birds still fuck when densely packed into a pitch-black enclosure with 86 of their fellow bird friends? Of course it will take more time and more birds before we can answer these questions completely, but we\u2019re very encouraged by the results we\u2019re already seeing, and we believe we\u2019re just scratching the surface of all the valuable insights we can learn from this extraordinary phenomenon.\u201d", "While the team initially centered their research around seagulls, an unexpected $92 million grant from the NIH allowed them to expand the scope of their work to include other bird species, most of which also demonstrated the ability to fly when inside a duffel bag, albeit with some fascinating variations in behavior. Owls, for instance, were able to float the duffel bag around completely silently, without generating the terrified screeching sounds produced by most other types of birds. Geese managed to arrange themselves into their distinctive V formation when divided into multiple duffel bags in the same room. And though normally flightless penguins were still unable to fly when zipped up in a duffel bag, they were impressively able to gently propel the bag around the ocean floor when tossed in the water, which was not the case for species like hummingbirds and cardinals when similarly tested.\u00a0", "Amazing!\u00a0", "There is still so much left to learn about the world around us and the marvelous creatures that inhabit it.

When Brittany walked into the fluorescent-lit nail salon and smelled the heavy, toxic fumes hanging in the air, she was ready to take a load off, and she wasted no time asking the 13-year-old boy at the front desk to get her an appointment for relaxation, STAT. And now that she\u2019s in the pedicure chair, all her work stress, family stress, and regular old pandemic stress is just melting away, so much so that she isn\u2019t bothered in the slightest that the elderly woman hunched over her feet keeps taking breaks to sigh loudly and let out a bunch of wet-sounding coughs.", "Wow! Way to make time for yourself, Brittany!", "Since Brittany got to the salon, multiple employees have been seen walking to the back with their cash tips and handing them over to an angry man who seems to be the salon\u2019s owner, but this isn\u2019t messing up Brittany\u2019s mood in the slightest. Rather than let herself fall into a spiral of worry over whether these women are being exploited, she\u2019s instead chosen to just sit back, close her eyes, and feel all her worries melt away as the massage chair gently kneads her knotted muscles.\u00a0", "It would probably totally bum Brittany out if she were to dwell on the fact that you can see a cot in the backroom of the salon that employees presumably sleep on due to not being able to afford housing, but she is simply too caught up in the pleasure of the gentle foot rub that her nail technician is giving her to be bothered by any of the troubles of the world. She also does not seem to have noticed that all of the workers in the salon are clearly immigrants from the same Southeast Asian country with an appalling human rights record, which is certainly not just a happy coincidence. She\u2019s just feeling too rejuvenated by her new lavender toenails to worry about whether any of the employees at the salon are trapped in a cycle of modern-day slavery, and her mental health is all the better for it.", "Nice!", "Clearly, Brittany understands that self-care is healthcare, and she is proving just how necessary it is to regularly make time for yourself and focus on your own needs instead of all the unfortunate realities of life.

At the time, the orphans were ashamed to be seen crouching in gutters eating their watery rations, listening to posh Londoners call them \u201cfilthy urchins\u201d as they passed by in their chic finery.

These inspiring children could\u2019ve easily opted to leave their painful mush memories behind and build an entirely new life for themselves, but they instead chose to wield the very substance of their poverty and dress it with premium toppings to sell at a major markup\u2014turning the taste of oppression into the flavor of success.\u00a0\u00a0", "In just six months since opening the business, the ragtag gang of fatherless boys has managed to create a restaurant so popular that not even the Headmaster himself can land a reservation\u2014a fact that clearly infuriates him to no end, as every time he encounters the children on the street now, he turns beet-red and pivots away with an embarrassed huff. Upper-class Londoners who previously would\u2019ve never been caught dead eating gruel are now going to great lengths to snag a table at the exclusive spot, where right past the front door the orphans have proudly hung the dirty rag they used to suck on after sopping up the last dregs of their hot cereal.

Now you must imprison it inside of a dangerous garbage bag called a \u2018condom.\u2019\u201d The researchers have postulated that these types of statements are indicative of a widespread misunderstanding among sex education teachers of what condoms actually are and how they work, which may help explain why 15,000 of them end up suffocating inside one every single year.", "Absolutely chilling.", "Clearly, this study should serve as a major wakeup call that there needs to be serious change in our nation\u2019s health classes. When taught in an effective and fact-based manner, sex ed has the potential to save lives of not only students, but also the educators tasked with teaching responsible sexual behaviors.

Dumbledore then ushered all the quidditch players away from Hagrid, leaving him alone in the cafeteria, where he quietly sobbed while eating the entire breakfast spread that had been prepared for the recruits by himself.", "On this occasion, Hagrid had a group of recruits over to his shed in the woods, which is an incredibly upsetting place to be. It\u2019s basically just a dingy hovel in the middle of the forest that smells like Icy Hot and animal shit, but on this particular night, the recruits didn\u2019t really seem to mind. A few of them had managed to get their hands on some beer, and everyone was just having a genuinely nice time drinking and hanging out until, somewhere along the line, someone made the mistake of giving Hagrid some beers, which he 100 percent could not handle. He almost instantly started putting his arm around people and saying off-putting shit, like, \u201cYou guys gotta let me know where you\u2019re bunking next year so I can come live with you,\u201d and, \u201cEveryone thinks they\u2019re better than me just because I don\u2019t know how to read.\u201d The recruits mostly just ignored him, but then he broke down in tears and began blubbering about how he has no idea when his birthday is, the same way people don\u2019t know with rescue dogs.", "\u00a0\u201cYou guys are so lucky and you don\u2019t even know it,\u201d he said, his voice trembling, staring numbly at his can of Miller High Life. \u201cMe, I don\u2019t even have a birthday. Don\u2019t know when it is, like I\u2019m a damn dog!\u201d He then took his shirt off, explaining he was overheated, before continuing: \u201cIt\u2019d just be nice to have my own special day, y\u2019know? A day when everyone has to be nice to you, when no one hurts your feelings or\u2026.\u201d He trailed off and sort of just sat there for a while, making things extremely awkward for everyone there. A couple kids patted his back in support, but it wasn\u2019t long before everyone started finding excuses to leave, and within 10 minutes or so all the recruits had fled, leaving Hagrid to sit alone in the dark, yearning for a birthday that he\u2019ll never have.", "This was another party that started off fine but quickly went south. Everyone was hanging outside in Hagrid\u2019s yard because the inside was filled with dead animals Hagrid had been practicing taxidermy on. The recruits were just sipping on some 40s and having a pleasant time until Hagrid at one point stood up and declared, \u201cChooo boy, I\u2019ll tell you what, all this party needs is a beautiful woman riding a mechanical bull, right? You ever see that? Nothing sexier than that.\u201d The kids pretended like they didn\u2019t hear Hagrid, but this didn\u2019t deter him at all, as he suddenly whipped out his trusty umbrella\u2014which, remember, he had to use for magic because his wand was confiscated years earlier when Dumbledore overheard him bragging in the teacher\u2019s lounge about using it to stab a garter snake\u2014and shouted, \u201cGimme some rock, gimme some roll, gimme a sexy mechanical bull.\u201d This was clearly not the correct spell to use, as a real bull then appeared before them instead of a mechanical one, and its legs were basically soldered to the ground just below its knees. The thing instantly started shrieking and violently attempting to uproot itself, but to no avail. All it could do was yank and pull and moan in a wild herky-jerky panic, like a mouse stuck to a glue trap. Everyone was utterly horrified, and once Hagrid realized people weren\u2019t having fun, tried to fix things using a different spell, but this only succeeded in setting the bull on fire\u2014a sight that left all of the recruits deeply traumatized. With Hagrid unable to get the situation under control, a next-level-pissed-off Dumbledore eventually had to get out of bed and wander over to the party in his pajamas, where he then performed a spell that was meant to humanely euthanize the bull but instead made the poor thing start convulsing like a motherfucker for a good half hour before it finally passed away. It was later discovered that Hagrid\u2019s spell had caused the bull\u2019s hooves to take root in the ground like a tree, and the hoof-roots had spread so far that they couldn\u2019t be dug out with a shovel. Hogwarts had to order a special CAT excavator to remove the animal, but it took a long time to ship, leaving the bull there to rot for a good few weeks, its nauseating stench wafting over campus every time there was a breeze. Just an absolute shitshow all around.\u00a0\u00a0", "This recruit party immediately got off to a bad start, as Hagrid didn\u2019t have any booze or drugs to facilitate the fun, leaving the kids bored and visibly pissed. Hagrid explained that he couldn\u2019t buy them any illicit substances due to the fact that Hogwarts doesn\u2019t pay him a salary and his government benefits card can only be used on basic groceries and stuff. However, he claimed that he knew something way more fun than booze and drugs, at which point he leapt to his feet, tied the rope he uses as a belt very tightly around his neck, and then violently choked himself for a good 15 minutes or so before eventually losing consciousness and falling chin-first into a brick ledge. For a while after, he sort of just laid there on the ground bleeding all over the place, looking dead as shit. And keep in mind that he never explained the choking game beforehand, so all of the recruits thought they had just watched him kill himself. However, after the initial shock subsided, a few kids started rummaging through Hagrid\u2019s drawers and shit, looking for jewelry to pawn. Hagrid awoke about 45 minutes later to find that almost all of the kids were gone, and the ones who were left were lifting up his mattress looking for cash. \u201cW-w-w-where is everyone?\u201d Hagrid mumbled in a super pronounced stutter that would stay with him for the rest of his life. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys wanna party with me?\u201d It was all so fucking depressing. Someone let Hagrid\u2019s dog out while he was unconscious, too, and she was not the kind of dog who\u2019s allowed outside because she runs away, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. Hagrid whined and stuttered about this dog all night, wondering if the recruits took her back to the dorms maybe. But that dog was long gone. It took off into the woods and was almost immediately hunted down and eaten by a centaur. Just a sad situation start to finish.\u00a0\u00a0", "After realizing that the parties at his shed never exactly went over well, one year Hagrid decided that the recruits might have more fun if he took them to a Russian bathhouse. The spa was about an hour away from Hogwarts in a lower-middle-class suburb, nestled in a largely vacant stripmall between a Petco and a dirty-looking pizza place whose door was held open with a cinderblock, and everything about it was super underwhelming. Not only was the place disgusting, but it was packed wall-to-wall with elderly Eastern European men in nothing but robes, their flaky, dead-looking dongs dangling freely before the kids\u2019 eyes. The recruits were visibly uncomfortable, but for whatever reason Hagrid was having the time of his fucking life. The dude was in rare form. Maybe it was excitement of being away from Hogwarts for the first time in several years, or maybe he found all the ancient dongs titillating\u2014no way to know, honestly.\u00a0 But within the first 15 seconds of stepping inside that spa lobby, Hagrid giddily announced to the kids, \u201cI\u2019m getting a hand job today,\u201d then proceeded to beg all of the masseuses there one by one to give him a handjob in exchange for Hogwarts class credits. Meanwhile, the unsupervised kids did what unsupervised kids do. They found the kitchen and stole a bunch of weird Russian beers and cans of whipped cream, got all fucked up on alcohol and whippets, and, only about 20 minutes after stepping into the lobby, one of the recruits got too fucked up and drowned in one of the cold-water pools, where he was discovered face-down in the water, drifting lifelessly near the chrome handrail by the stairs. This ended up being a huge nightmare for Hogwarts, as not only did the school have to pay out a massive settlement to the dead kid\u2019s parents, but the quidditch program had all of its wins vacated and was served an unprecedented five-year suspension from league play. From that day forward, Hogwarts had no choice but to center its athletics program around the bowling team, which didn\u2019t exactly bring in alumni dollars like the quidditch team did. It was a disaster scenario for the school, and it was all thanks to Hagrid\u2019s utter inability to throw a decent party."]},

However, crabs live at the beach full time, so they\u2019re always having fun in the sun, which, if you think about it, is a truly wise way to live.

Not to mention, falcons can perch on people\u2019s arms, which is not something any stupid old bird can do. Most birds would not even be able to differentiate between an arm and a length of PVC pipe. Falcons are truly bringing something unique to the table. They are creatures of utility, with brains that are far larger than their golfball-size skulls might suggest. We can learn from them.", "One of the three differences between baby cheetahs and owls is that baby cheetahs are adorable while owls are just sort of neutral. So in terms of looks, a baby cheetah would be a far cuter option for a symbol of wisdom, which is definitely something to take into consideration. And while baby cheetahs aren\u2019t known for being particularly smart, that could change with a bit of clever marketing. Imagine a poster of a cute baby cheetah with text in papyrus font that reads, \u201cThey may be young, but they sure are wise. Baby cheetahs: the Keepers of Knowledge.\u201d People would totally buy into it.

If this dog hasn\u2019t already fatally succumbed to his many genetic flaws and respiratory deformities, then we should strongly consider him as a potential successor to owls. He is giving us serious Einstein vibes!", "We know that wasps aren\u2019t an obvious pick and that something like elephants might make more sense (super old and therefore wise), but elephants are for sure going to go extinct at some point in the next century, so we really can\u2019t count on them. Wasps, however, are all over the goddamn place. Most people have probably seen, like, three owls max, but wasps? You\u2019ve probably seen thousands! And you can tell that wasps have a good head on their shoulders, too, because they enjoy all of the benefits of being bees (getting to fly, sting stuff, etc.) but without having to deal with any of the bullshit work (making honey, pollinating the planet, etc.)\u2014they\u2019ve totally gamed the system, and that surely is no accident. That\u2019s strategic brilliance. So, look, we\u2019re not saying we hope anything happens to owls, but if they do in fact end up going the way of the dinosaurs (God forbid!), there are billions of wasps ready to take the baton.

Walt\u2019s insistence that Juan and the other 5 children on this list never enjoy Disneyworld may seem cruel, but considering there are billions of children he welcomed into his park with open arms, having a mere 6 kids who aren\u2019t welcome isn\u2019t really a huge deal, so relax."]},

The researchers later confirmed this theory after spotting another pod of the turtles in a neighboring coral reef engaging in similar behavior, provocatively slapping their yellow-hued bellies with one fin while rapidly plunging their cloacas with the other, the plastic soda rings around their necks stifling their rapturous churrs and causing their eyes to bulge disturbingly from their skulls.\u00a0", "\u201cWhile man-made pollution certainly poses a grave threat to marine animals, this alarming pattern of harmful sexual behavior involving six-pack rings we\u2019re seeing among sea turtle populations suggests that they may very well be their own worst enemies,\u201d said Dr. Richard Abdelati, the lead researcher on the project. \u201cThat said, rigor mortis preserved many of the turtles\u2019 dying expressions, and nearly all of them were grinning in ecstasy.

Had the guy seemed more approachable (perhaps by NOT wearing eye patches over both his right eye and his chin), we could have argued that hairless cats are way too polarizing to appear on a cute cat list, but we don\u2019t want to go near him and his potential chin eye.

He paddled ferociously, his arms slicing through the water like oars on a Viking ship. \u2018Come on\u2026 come on\u2026\u2019 He felt the wave lift the back of his board. It had him. No. He had it. He stood up and carved down the face of the wave, the barrel curling around him. Sheltering him. He could live in here, he thought. Just enough room for a twin bed. Cheap rent too. And how about that view? The sparkling sea, palm trees arching on the shore, some old man in an innertube\u2014SPLASH! Five seconds later, he emerged from the whitewater and turned on the leathery old man who had ruined the best ride he\u2019d had all day. \u2018What the heck, dude?\u2019 The old timer just looked at him quizzically and floated away. Up on the shore, Cory had stopped filming and was laughing his butt off. Liam rolled his eyes, got on his board, and paddled in, swerving to avoid all the swimmers, body-surfers, boogie-boarders, and other non-surfers. \u2018Dude,\u2019 said Liam, walking up to Cory, \u2018What\u2019s with all the people?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s that new road off Laguna, bro,\u2019 said Cory, reviewing footage of Liam\u2019s ride on his DSLR. \u2018Spot\u2019s blown, man. RIP.\u2019 Liam looked out across the beach. He was right. The spot was blown. The perfectly neglected tail end of Vasquez Beach had been ruined by the masses. \u2018Well, did you at least get that last one on tape?\u2019 asked Liam. \u2018I need more barrels for the reel. That\u2019s all the sponsors care about.\u2019 Cory laughed. \u2018Oh, you mean that old guy in an innertube totally dropping in on you? Yeah, bro, don\u2019t worry. I got it all.\u2019 Liam punched him in the arm. \u2018It\u2019s not funny, Cory. This is my shot at a real sponsorship. I need more footage if I\u2019m gonna stand out. Where else can we go?\u2019 Cory thought for a second, then grinned. \u2018I know a spot\u2026\u2019. Next thing Liam knew, they were pulling up to a fence topped with barbed wire at the end of Calle Brando. \u2018This is the spot?\u2019 asked Liam, incredulously. \u2018Come on,\u2019 said Cory, \u2018There\u2019s a hole in here somewhere\u2026\u2019 They found the hole, climbed through the fence and walked down the trail past the brush. Soon, Liam found himself staring at the most perfect break he\u2019d ever seen in his life. Wave after wave rolled in, each one more beautiful than the last. He was pissed. \u2018How the heck have you never told me about this spot?\u2019 he said, glaring at Cory. \u2018You\u2019re not a local, bro,\u2019 said Cory, feeling a little guilty. \u2018Am too,\u2019 Liam retorted. \u2018Nah, man,\u2019 said Cory, \u2018I mean, like, local local. It\u2019s like a code, you know?\u2019 Liam looked down at the sand. Sure, he was born in Seattle. But he\u2019d moved to the bay when he was six. And he was easily the best surfer in town. Scouts for multiple surf brands had asked him to submit footage for potential sponsorship after a recent competition win. How could anybody\u2014his best friend no less\u2014still think he wasn\u2019t a local? \u2018I can\u2019t believe you held out on this secret spot until now,\u2019 said Liam. \u2018Dude, can you relax,\u2019 said Cory. \u2018I\u2019m literally telling you about it now. Because I know this reel is important to you.\u2019 Liam softened. \u2018Thanks,\u2019 he said. \u2018Is this where the old pier used to be?\u2019 \u2018Yep,\u2019 said Cory, mischievously. \u2018Hurricane Bryce did a number on it. But some die-hards still surf it. I hear the busted pylons make the break pretty dope.\u2019 Liam smiled. \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what he did. The first ride Liam caught was the best he\u2019d ever had. He tore it up, his board moving across the water like a hockey puck on ice. It was pure, liquid heaven. And Cory was getting it all in high definition with his DSLR. Liam felt invincible. Like the only thing in the entire world that existed was him, his board, and the water that seemed to cradle him like a newborn infant. WHAM! Next thing Liam knew he was ten feet underwater, bleeding from his head. He didn\u2019t understand what had happened. Maybe an outside he hadn\u2019t seen? Suddenly, he saw something move between the forest of broken pylons nearby. It was long. And dark. And fast. He breached the surface. \u2018You good, dude?\u2019 Cory yelled from the shore. He flashed him the \u2018OK\u2019 sign. He\u2019d wiped out before way worse than this. And he wasn\u2019t ready to call it a day on the greatest break he\u2019d ever seen in his life. Sure enough, the next wave was even more beautiful than the last. A twenty-footer, at least. Riding big waves could feel like a battle sometimes. But this felt like sliding down a mountain of butter. He could hear Cory cheering on the shore as he got tubed, the water forming a cocoon around him. Eat your heart out, sponsors. \u2018OUT OF THE WAY!\u2019 Suddenly, a surfer on a long board sliced down the face of the wave, knocking him off his board. He went through the washing machine this time, cutting his arm on a busted pylon. He breached the surface and coughed up seawater. \u2018Dude, what happened?\u2019 Cory shouted from the shore. \u2018You were crushing it and then, like, you weren\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Some guy dropped in on me!\u2019 Liam shouted. \u2018There\u2019s nobody here, dude,\u2019 said Cory. Liam looked around. Cory was right. There was no one for miles. \u2018I swear, there was this other guy\u2026 a long boarder\u2014\u2019 but Cory cut him off. \u2018OUTSIDE!\u2019 Liam turned around and saw the wave. It was twice the size of the last one. He\u2019d only surfed waves like this on the Big Island and never without a tow-in. He had to paddle up and over it fast or it would slam him down onto one of the deadly pylons lurking just below the surface. Wiping the blood out of his eyes, he raced up the approaching wave. \u2018Come on\u2026 come on\u2026\u2019 he said under his breath, his arms working harder than they ever had before to propel him upwards towards safety. He crested the wave just in time, and slid down its back as it demolished the shoreline. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh. The absurdity of how close he\u2019d come to losing that gamble every surfer makes. How close he\u2019d come to dying. \u2018Did you get that, Cory?\u2019 He shouted towards the beach. But Cory wasn\u2019t there. Where was he? Liam started paddling in. Then he saw something bob to the surface in the frothy whitewater of the wave\u2019s wreckage\u2014Cory\u2019s DSLR. \u2018Cory!\u2019 He shouted. Liam looked around, frantically searching for any sign of his friend. He jumped off his board and dove underwater. There! Liam could just make him out in the murky depths, clinging to a pylon. He swam down to help him. But he couldn\u2019t pull him to the surface. Then he realized what it was. Cory wasn\u2019t clinging to the pylon. He was stuck on it. Impaled straight through the gut. Liam was swimming in his blood. He screamed, bubbles erupting from his mouth. Suddenly, he remembered his own survival and shot to the surface, gasping for air. \u2018Help!\u2019 he shouted, knowing no one was there. Then he saw something. Someone on a long board. Heading towards him to catch a ride. \u2018Please, help! My friend\u2026 there\u2019s been\u2026\u2019 but he was too tired. He couldn\u2019t get the words out. As the long boarder got closer, Liam saw that there was something off about him. There were holes in his wetsuit. Wait\u2026 not just his wetsuit\u2026 but his actual skin! Holes where his flesh appeared to have rotted away, the little that was left barely tethered to his bones. Holes through which water sloshed, and the sunset behind him glowed a malevolent red. He smiled horribly as he caught his ride. \u2018Locals\u2026 only\u2026\u2019 he roared as he dropped in down the face of the wave, the nose of his board slicing through the water\u2026 and straight through Liam\u2019s neck.\u201d"]},

Word that Lila only had a Peacock Premium membership spread quickly around the school, and as she walked through the halls later that day, she could hear students calling her a \u201ccommercial-watching loser\u201d under their breath.", "Since then, Lila has been on the receiving end of some relentless bullying by her peers.

Lila even asked if it could be considered an early birthday gift, but her parents reminded her that she used that reasoning to get a month\u2019s worth of $7.99 ad-free Quibi back in June to binge ", "Chrissy\u2019s Court", ".", "This is all so tragic. Everyone should be treated equally, regardless of what Peacock plan their family has.

The department explained that cars are far better equipped to perform in dense traffic and dizzying exhaust fumes than horses, which are easily startled by loud noises and can only achieve a pitiful max speed of around 30 MPH, leaving them woefully ill-equipped to navigate the city\u2019s busy streets in pursuit of crime.", "\u201cHorses don\u2019t have seatbelts, they don\u2019t have sirens or a horn you can honk, and you can\u2019t even take them on the highway\u2014it just no longer makes sense to keep committing so much time and effort to maintaining these animals when cars are so much better than them in every single way,\u201d said New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, adding that you also don\u2019t have to feed cars half their body weight in oats each day or collect their feces with a shovel, which is appealing. \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s a unit of measurement called \u2018horsepower\u2019 that gauges how many hundreds of times stronger a car is than a horse makes us pretty confident we\u2019re making the right decision here.\u201d", "\u201cRarely in the line of duty does an officer encounter a situation where it\u2019d be useful to have a horse\u2014it\u2019s not like first responders were calling dispatch on 9/11 to send in horse backup,\u201d he continued. \u201cCars, on the other hand\u2026cars are just fantastic.\u201d\u00a0", "Shea went on to say that a designated NYPD task force has been slaughtering the horses with a penetrative bolt gun and then selling them off to a rendering plant, where their bodies are being broken down into crude materials for industrial manufacturing, thereby contributing much more to the world than they would\u2019ve had they remained cops and alive. Additionally, it was noted that killing off the horses will save the department millions of dollars a year, money that will then be reallocated to purchase more police cars and more sirens for the police cars they already have.\u00a0", "This is a seriously major move from the NYPD, and while there are certainly more urgent things they could\u2019ve focused on reforming first, you can\u2019t deny that this was a good call. After all, it\u2019s hard to feel safe when those who\u2019ve been entrusted with protecting the general public are large animals who have literally no fucking clue that that\u2019s their job.

He uses bizarre words and phrases I have never heard before, and he usually does not describe sex accurately.

Your Brother In Sex can be a man or a woman, but they always have to be taller than you or else it doesn\u2019t count as sex. Sex with someone who isn\u2019t taller than you isn\u2019t sex. It\u2019s just a loud, wet hug. Now, as far as genitals go, some people have vaginas, but you, my boy, have a Witch\u2019s Broomstick. When you are filled with sexual hunger, your Witch\u2019s Broomstick will become long. It is called a Witch\u2019s Broomstick because once it becomes long, a small rat will come out of a hole in the wall and he\u2019ll ride around on it like a witch riding on a broomstick. You need to run around the room balancing the rat on your Witch\u2019s Broomstick while your Brother In Sex gets naked and yells, \u2018Oh, no! A witch!\u2019 This goes on for about an hour, and then you flush the rat down the toilet. Then the sex is done and a baby crawls out of the darkness and becomes your daughter.

I said, \u201cDad, what are you doing here?\u201d and he said, \u201cBe quiet. Sex is when two people go in and out. Your sexual organ is called The Arm Which Is Not Your Own. You cannot control The Arm Which Is Not Your Own. It is a part of your body that belongs to God and not to you. Anyway, when it\u2019s time for sex, The Arm Which Is Not Your Own will become long and point at things. It will point at rocks and slugs and books and shoes and furniture and so on. Whatever it points at, your Brother In Sex must use a label maker to clearly label what that thing. Once The Arm Which Is Not Your Own is done pointing at things it will go back to sleep. Then the sex is over and someone far away will become pregnant and give birth to your replacement. This is how sex is accomplished, and it\u2019s fine. A 5-out-of-10 experience. Goodnight.\u201d Then my dad slithered back under my bed and went to sleep.", "I thought after giving me the sex talk twice in two years my dad would be done, but I was mistaken. When I was 15 years old, I got into a car to take my driving test and instead of my instructor I found my dad seated in the passenger seat. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to learn to drive, then I need to tell you about sex,\u201d said my dad. \u201cSex is when two people fight each other with their groins. My son, between your legs, you have something disgusting and wonderful called Your Drooping Majesty. You must use your Drooping Majesty to have sex. Your Drooping Majesty is only good when it is limp and flops around like a sock. When you become insane with sexual lunacy, your Drooping Majesty becomes stiff and boring, and so you and your Brother In Sex need to hit it with a rake until it falls back asleep. Once your Drooping Majesty is limp and flopping around in a healthy manner, that is when you must swing it back and forth in order to hypnotize yourself. Once you are done hypnotizing yourself, you will fall asleep and your Brother In Sex will spend the rest of the night downloading viruses onto your computer. This is how sex works, and it\u2019s beautiful. At the end of sex, a baby crawls out of the cave and becomes your nephew.\u201d Then my dad pushed me out of the car, got into the driver seat, and drove the car into the forest.", "After getting the sex talk three times, I figured I would never have to go through it again, but apparently my dad operates under the impression that it\u2019s his duty as a parent to give me the sex talk as often as possible.

When you have sex, you are going to be attacked by swarms of birds and bees. Fortunately for you, right between your legs you have a tool called The Exterminator, which is like a fleshy whip that you must use to swat away the birds and bees that are attacking you. Sex is when your Brother In Sex screams and screams while you use your Exterminator to kill these animals. When all the birds and bees have been swatted away, then the sex is over, and your grandmother will become pregnant with me. Then I will be born and I will be ready to be your father.\u201d My dad patted me on the back and then spent the rest of the graduation ceremony asking kids from my class if he could have their diploma.", "When I was 29, I got married. During the reception, my father clinked a spoon against his champagne glass to get everyone\u2019s attention, and once everyone had quieted down he turned to me and said, \u201cSon, it\u2019s time that you and I had a frank talk about sex. Sex is when two people make naked pretzels with each other\u2019s bodies. And son, between your legs you have the key to having sex: The Long Nose That Must Be Kept Hidden. It is a special nose that dangles down from your groin and it loves to smell flowers and garbage. But you must always wear your loincloth in order to conceal the Long Nose between your legs. If you let people see your secret Long Nose, you will be exiled to the tundra. The Long Nose That Must Be Kept Hidden can only be seen by your Brother In Sex, and tonight, your Brother In Sex will probably be your wife. You will allow her to see the secret nose that lives beneath. When the Long Nose That Must Be Kept Hidden smells that sex is about to happen, it will become long and stiff, which sex doctors call Going Pinnochio. Once your sexual nose Goes Pinocchio, you must use it to bang on a gong over and over again. While you are banging the gong, your wife should get naked and go to sleep. The sound of the gong ringing will cause news reporters from all over the country to run into your bedroom, where they will see your Long Nose That Must Be Kept Hidden. They will photograph it and write front page stories about how they saw the secret nose of your groin. Since it is illegal for anyone to see this thing, you will be carted off to the tundra while your wife is free to get married to a professional baseball player. That is sex. Sex is when you ring a gong and go to the tundra. As a result of the sex, a baby will come flying out of a hole in the ground, and that baby will pull your dogsled across the tundra. Okay, enjoy the rest of your wedding.\u201d Then my dad told my grandparents that they should get divorced, and then he spent the rest of the night begging the DJ to play the Soviet Union national anthem."]},

As the book details, \u201cHe walked and he tramped on his floppy green feet / Scowling and studying his midwife worksheets / With hate in his heart and a dislike for others / he vowed to scare babies right out of their mothers.\u201d When the Grinch arrives at the church basement where the test is being administered, he becomes furious at all the happy, excited future midwives chatting animatedly without him, and he jumps atop the cafeteria-style table and screaming, \u201cYou mealy-mouthed fools, I\u2019m the king of the nurses / One day you\u2019ll all die from my nasty nurse curses!\u201d As soon as he finishes the exam, though, the Grinch grabs his answer sheet, runs it through the proctor\u2019s Scantron, and learns that he\u2019s received a 100 percent thanks to his incredible passion for midwifery. He then huffs and puffs home to his mountain lair and begins applying for jobs.\u00a0", "Seuss\u2019s next book on the topic centered around the Grinch\u2019s first job as a midwife. The residents of a town called Snozzenville narrate the story, which begins, \u201cThe Big Green Midwife rode in on a horse / he was angry and sneering and Grinchy, of course! / \u2018Give me your preggos!\u2019 the furry fiend yelled! / \u2018I\u2019ll grab all their babies, I\u2019m the midwife from hell!\u2019\u201d Once the Grinch arrives, he jumps down from his bright pink steed, snarling and barking out facts about reproductive health and the importance of light exercise during pregnancy. Without missing a beat, he tiptoes angrily over to an extremely pregnant Snozzler and commands her to take deep breaths as he uses his green, spider-like fingers to open up a compartment on her belly and peer inside. The Grinch then turns the enormous Snozzler upside-down and shakes her until seven shriveled-up infant Snozzlers tumble out onto the ground, at which point he gives her the devastating news that \u201cI tried hard to save them, I gave it my all / But sadly their hearts are two sizes too small.\u2019\u201d He asks for and receives permission to eat the little stillborn Snozzlers, and he then \u201cSwallows them whole, from their heads to their feet / Savoring each scrap of the wee Snozzlers\u2019 meat\u201d. After, the story abruptly ends with the Grinch forcing his business cards on all the rest of the Snozzlers and informing them that, \u201cI accept Medicaid\u2014if you\u2019re broke, do not fear,\u201d prompting all the low-income Snozzler mothers to \u201clet out a great cheer.\u201d According to Seuss\u2019s biographer, publishers passed on the book due to its \u201cheavy profanity and disturbing depictions of fetal death.\u201d", "Seuss went on to write a book about birth control narrated by the Grinch himself, full of tips like \u201cYou cannot get pregnant inside of a rocket / You cannot get pregnant with coins in your pocket! / You ", "can ", "become pregnant from the sperm of a Whuglee / But their bad rotten genes will make your baby quite ugly!\u201d The wildly incorrect reproductive facts and the thinly veiled pro-eugenics commentary ultimately failed to win over publishers, but even though the book never went to print, Seuss frequently referred to it later in life as his \u201cmost treasured work.\u201d", "This holiday tale depicts the ever-grouchy Grinch as the founder and lead practitioner at his own holistic midwifery practice, where he trains younger midwives and oversees births from his clinic atop a steep, pointy hill in a town called Bilderdeebee. On Christmas Eve, as the nurses are preparing to go home to their families, they see what looks like an enormous centipede approaching the clinic that in fact turns out to be \u201cA line of one squillion short-legged Sprees / Pregnant as pregnant as pregnant could be.\u201d The Grinch turns to his employees to tell them that they can\u2019t go home for Christmas and instead must attend to the pregnant Sprees, but he sees the sadness in their eyes and feels a pang of remorse, remembering the many Christmases he spent alone, studying late for anatomy tests or working overnight in maternity wards. In an uncharacteristic stroke of kindness, he sends the nurses home and springs into action, taking it upon himself to deliver all the babies. \u201cHe took the first Spree by her big fuzzy ear / And extracted her young with the smuggest of sneers / As fluids and viscera spread o\u2019er the floor / He grabbed the next Spree and he did it once more.\u201d He works tirelessly until sunup delivering baby after baby in assembly-line fashion, which Seuss describes in increasingly graphic anatomical detail over the course of the 60-page saga. Upon completing the Herculean task, the Grinch finally sits down to catch his breath only to see another group coming up the hill towards him\u2014his nurses! They shout, \u201cMerry Christmas, Midwife Grinch\u201d as they present him with an enormous roast possum (his favorite food) and invite him to come down the hill and celebrate Christmas with them. Seuss explained in a late-in-life interview that his later work, ", "How The Grinch Stole Christmas", ", was really just a hasty rewrite of ", "Merry Christmas, Midwife Grinch", ", the latter of which his editors ended up rejecting due to its deeply upsetting descriptions of the Sprees\u2019 fantastical umbilical cords and the convoluted series of wacky genital flaps the Grinch must solve to access their birth canals. We can see where they\u2019re coming from, although given how much of a beloved classic ", "How The Grinch Stole Christmas", " became, we think the world would nonetheless be excited to welcome another Grinch tale into the Christmas canon.

Data shows that by age 40, the average Baby Boomer had experienced at least 65 separate cottage cheese recipes, ranging from simple breakfast dishes involving heaping scoops of cottage cheese with canned fruit to more elaborate holiday casseroles involving cottage cheese and ham, whereas Millennials are not only eating far fewer cottage cheese-based entrees, but also fewer sides where cottage cheese is inexplicably served with iceberg lettuce and pineapple rings.\u00a0", "\u201cThe statistical rule of thumb has always been that each new generation enjoys a greater wealth of cottage cheese dishes thanks to the sacrifices and labor of the generations prior, but for the first time since the Civil War, that trend is now moving downward due to a number of adverse factors,\u201d explained the study\u2019s lead researcher Sarah Yeo. \u201cWith an ever-decreasing number of church picnics to attend each summer, fewer 1950s cookbooks with names like \u201cSimple Family Meals For The Dutiful Housewife\u201d still in print, and fewer five-hour swaths of available free time to dedicate to crafting elaborate cottage cheese and Frito dishes with olives carefully arranged into a happy face on top, it\u2019s just no longer realistic for young people to be able to expect to eat cottage cheese in some form two or three times a day like their parents.\u201d", "\u201cSadly, for many Millennials, the only way for them to enjoy desserts that are basically just cottage cheese and Cool Whip mixed in Keebler ready-made crusts is to simply move back in with their parents,\u201d she continued.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "Yeo added that, cottage cheese-wise, not only do Millennials have it much worse than their parents, but they\u2019ve also been saddled with the near-impossible task of salvaging an environment destroyed by the single-use aluminum containers that previous generations relied on to bring dishes like cottage cheese and Velveeta soup and cottage cheese crusted chicken piccata to potlucks.\u00a0", "This is deeply concerning.", "While Millennials often get a bad wrap as a spoiled generation, there\u2019s certainly nothing entitled about being the first wave of Americans to ever be deprived of consistent access to generous portions of cottage cheese-based foods.

He\u2019ll eventually realize that his son is honestly probably safer in the blimp than he is back on the ground, what with drunk drivers and school shootings and all that.

We were singing \u201cBe Thou My Vision\u201d when all of a sudden the sanctuary doors exploded open and, without any introduction or explanation, the resurrected Messiah sprinted full-speed down to the pulpit, snatched the mic from the worship leader, and started singing a hymn He wrote called\u00a0 \u201cSega Dreamcast, Guide My Heart\u201d. Everyone was just staring at Him in total awe as He belted out stanza after stanza, singing lines like \u201cCrazy Taxi, fill my heart / Tony Hawk, help me see\u201d in His very high falsetto. None of us ever thought we would get a chance to behold our Savior here on Earth, so it was definitely a huge surprise to see Him in our little church singing about how He loves video games but only gets to play them after God goes to bed because God thinks they\u2019re a waste of time. It was the most special thing any of us had ever witnessed! ", "We all figured Jesus appearing to sing to us was a one-time thing, but He ended up showing up again just a couple weeks later at our Easter service, where He performed a three-hour rock opera about the Old Testament that was honestly pretty terrible. The incredibly long-winded song started out with a meandering 20-minute meditation on God creating the waterfowl and then continued from there with a chapter-by-chapter retelling of every single thing that happened in the Old Testament, with Jesus seemingly improvising every single part, including a cringey emo-ish interlude about Abraham impregnating Hagar that Jesus clearly intended to be deeply moving but instead just made everyone pretty uncomfortable. Front to back, the whole performance was undeniably a disaster, but to be fair, music has evolved quite a bit since Jesus lived on Earth. Maybe the song would\u2019ve been an absolute banger back in His day.\u00a0 ", "After the rock opera debacle, it was over a year before Jesus came to sing for us again, but when He finally did show up, He really pulled out all the stops.

The kids in the congregation went crazy for it, and it was nice to see them so excited about the man who died for all of our sins. It was a great day to have Jesus at our church, and we were all smiling from ear to ear!", "One of Jesus\u2019 best performances was when He showed up at our church\u2019s spring fair and commandeered the loudspeaker system to teach everyone a dance called \u201cThe Jesus Slide\u201d. First of all, He floated straight down from Heaven into the parking lot where we were holding the fair, which was awesome to watch. And then, as soon as He hit the ground, He started yelling dance commands, like \u201cSink down to the ground! Now howl at your friend! Howl a lil\u2019 louder! Jesus Slide, everyone!\u201d He got everyone moving, even the old grandmas who were manning the ticket booth. It was definitely a spring fair to remember, and He was so happy with how it went that He made thousands of Tootsie Rolls rain down over everyone.

We all got excited when He yelled \u201cAnd now it\u2019s time for another original Jesus Christ musical extravaganza!\u201d but as soon as He started, it was pretty clear He didn\u2019t have anything original because He basically just sang \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d To be fair, He did throw in a couple original lyrics here and there, although it honestly seemed like He was just doing that because He couldn\u2019t remember the real words. At one point He just stopped singing altogether and instead tried some weird jazz scatting, but that was pretty unremarkable too. He eventually sort of just ran out of steam and ended the song by awkwardly shouting, \u201cAnd that\u2019s\u2026The Jesus Rhapsody!\u201d Then everyone clapped for Him, although only to be polite\u2014no one actually thought the song was good.

In fact, she\u2019s got so little going on that the literal high point of each and every day for her is when she wakes up and gets to quietly enjoy a cup of coffee for several minutes. After this brief window of pleasure, pretty much nothing worthwhile happens for the rest of the day, and so she just occupies her time with pointless bullshit until it\u2019s time for bed.\u00a0 When she\u2019s sitting on the couch in the evening feeling down, Melanie often fantasizes about how in just 12 hours she\u2019ll be able to enjoy a delicious cup of drip coffee in the handcrafted ceramic mug she got on vacation in Montana last year. This would be a perfectly respectable ritual if not for the devastating fact that the momentary pleasure she gets from her cup of joe has the impossible task of carrying her through the entire rest of her interminable-seeming day, buoying her through her uninspired breakfast of cornflakes, her solitary afternoon spent staring at the computer, her sub-par YouTube yoga workout, and her nightly three-hour session of reality TV.", "Sadly, it recently got to the point where Melanie purchased a bottle of expensive vegan creamer to \u201cspice up\u201d her coffee routine, pathetically attempting to wring as much pleasure as possible out of the lone highlight of her day.

While it\u2019d undoubtedly be nice if Melanie had a couple of other little pleasant things to look forward to during her days, like perhaps a small herb garden she could tend to or maybe a cute dog that regularly passes by her window, the devastating reality is that she\u2019s really got jackshit going on, and the only thing that pulls her out of the hazy monotony of her everyday existence is the taste of the piping-hot Costco-brand coffee that she so eagerly enjoys each morning.", "God, what a bummer.\u00a0", "Listen, things are pretty rough for everyone right now, but it seems like Melanie is experiencing existential despair on a whole different level. Melanie, we\u2019re praying you fall in love or get a new job or something, because this coffee can\u2019t keep being the only thing you look forward to. Hang in there, girl!"]},

When she tearfully tried to explain this to God, the Almighty did not seem to listen, as He then declared that for so long as her heart remained hardened, He would continue to bring His wrath down upon her home and livestock. Seconds later, His voice suddenly went silent, and Dr. Ruth looked up just in time to see her dear pet Yorkie collapsed to the carpet and die, at which point a frenzied pack of jackals and flies swarmed the dog\u2019s corpse and rapidly devoured it.\u00a0\u00a0", "So sad!", "While it\u2019s still unclear ", "why", " all this is happening to Dr. Ruth, sources say that the iconic TV and radio host is now scrambling to do whatever she can to ward off God\u2019s fury, including smearing lamb\u2019s blood on her doorway and denouncing her Jewish faith to convert to Christianity.

And if the Book of Exodus is any indication, it\u2019s likely that Dr. Ruth will soon see a plague of locusts and perhaps even the death of her son, the latter of which is a possibility that has her especially concerned. Tragically, it seems that her decades of sex expertise are basically useless in terms of quelling God\u2019s anger, and there\u2019s probably nothing she can do at this point to stop God from finishing delivering His judgement.

We were going to make a Beatles record the way we used to: everyone yelling at each other and smiling at each other and killing each other and mailing jewels to one another. The fighting and the love, it was like a family. The kind of family that girls throw their underwear at. We were ready to do it.", "As recording for ", "Abbey Road", " began in earnest, The Beatles began to hit their creative stride. With each new recording session, the band would lay down another track that was destined to become a classic. And as the album progressed, the tension among the band members began to dissipate. The creation of a masterpiece was underway.\u00a0", " It was so nice to see the Bug Boys back in action! So beautiful were the Bug Boys when they sang their stupid music! They belched out beautiful melodies like \u201cCome Together\u201d and they burped up lovely noises like \u201cSomething\u201d! And I was spanking the ass of the drums and the drums were begging me to stop, screaming, \u201cRingo, do not spank our asses and make us go BRIFF BRIFF BRIFF (the sounds of the drums)\u201d and I would shout back, \u201cNEVER! My friends need me to spank your asses while they SNEEZE their music into the microphone!\u201d That is how it is between me and the drums. I love them, but I must spank them to help the Bug Boys because the Bug Boys are my best friends.", "Right from the start, the lads were on an absolute hot streak. That first week in the studio, they churned out several gems. We recorded \u201cCome Together,\u201d which is about a man who wants his entire softball team to sit on him, and we recorded \u201cOh! Darling,\u201d which is about a thing you can shout at an owl if you want. We also recorded \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden,\u201d which was only the second song Ringo had ever written for the band, and is about a place where you can hide your sandals from thieves.", "I wrote \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d after a man stole my sandals. I was lying on the beach daydreaming about the number 12 when all of a sudden a man looked at my sandals and said, \u201cThese sandals are actually mine because of something amazing I did during World War II,\u201d and then he took my sandals right off my feet. I screamed and screamed and screamed. And then I bought a new pair of sandals and I hid them at the bottom of the ocean, where an octopus would guard them. I heard that that same man tried to ride a submarine into the Octopus\u2019s Garden to steal my sandals again and the octopus killed him. That\u2019s what \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d is about, and I got to BURP OUT the words to the song while spanking the ass of the drums, which was very special for me.", "The whole band was writing and recording wonderful songs at an incredible pace. We were really on a roll, you know.", "John and I were writing music in that very collaborative way we used to in the early days of The Beatles. John would come into the studio with a guitar part, and I would add a bass line, and then John would come into the studio with a chorus, and I\u2019d add a verse, and then John would come into the studio with a cursed frog, and I would kiss the frog to turn it into a man, and then John and me and the frog man would all stand around for a bit and then the frog man would slowly die.", " We were experimenting with lots of different sonic techniques back then. Just completely pushing the envelope when it came to recording. One day, Paul dragged a dead deer he had hit with his car into the studio and recorded his vocals to \u201cOh Darling\u201d while standing near the carcass. Nobody had ever recorded pop music next to a dead animal before, and the reason why the song is good is because the dead deer was in the studio when we recorded the song.", "While we were recording \u201cOh! Darling,\u201d the dead deer that Paul had dragged into the studio was doing interesting things such as lifting its head up and screaming things like, \u201cStill I live!\u201d and \u201cFor some reason I have the memories of a man from the Middle Ages! I have vivid dreams about fighting in the Crusades!\u201d and \u201cIf you get me to a hospital in the next few hours, I believe you may yet save my life! Please! I am begging you for help!\u201d We recorded all of those weird deer noises and slowed them down, and then we used those noises for the bassline in \u201cOh! Darling\u201d. Then we threw the deer in the garbage.", "Paul and John were writing these amazing songs, as they always did, but the stuff George was coming up with was truly unbelievable.", " For a long time, Paul and John didn\u2019t respect me as a songwriter. Whenever I had a song on a Beatles record, they would call it the Dunce Section. That\u2019s why when you\u2019re listening to a Beatles record, you\u2019ll hear John introduce all my songs by saying, \u201cHi, everyone, welcome to the Dunce Section.

Spank our asses until we behave!\u201d and I had to tell the drums, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the drums, but the Bug Boys have written a song about the sun and there are no drums.\u201d And the drums said to me, \u201cBut if you don\u2019t spank us, then we\u2019ll become unruly, and we will do graffiti and kill people!\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, no! Both of those are crimes!\u201d", "We ended up adding drums to \u201cHere Comes The Sun\u201d because Ringo said that if we didn\u2019t add them, then his drums would do two types of crime, and the thought of this frightened us greatly.", "The drums are the little naughty gentlemen who make the sounds! If you do not spank them, then they will do crimes.", "Things were really going well at that stage.

Why couldn\u2019t it be like it was at the beginning of the Bug Boys, when we were all young and our eyes were higher up on our faces near our foreheads? Now we had become old and bitter, and our eyes rested above our lips like mustaches. The tides of time had pushed enmity and greed on us like driftwood from the sea. The old resentments we had tried to drown in the waters of the past had only become more polished and defined among the relentless currents of time, and now they\u2019d been deposited more fiercely radiant than ever upon our unguardable shores.", " In the early days of the band, when we had a fight, we would just resolve it by holding our breath and whoever passed out first got to do what they wanted.

But John thought we should get paid in dogs.", " It just makes more economic sense to get paid in dogs. Dogs eat burglars, and if you put them out in the sun, then they get pregnant and give birth to birds or mules or eels.", "George thought we should get paid in wind chimes.", "You can never have too many wind chimes. When they clang in the wind, the sound scares away Viking invaders, and if you hit them with a spoon, the sound they make attracts a stampede of birds and mules and eels.", " Ringo was trying to calm us down. He didn\u2019t care how he got paid as long as we were all getting along.", " My friends the Bug Boys were trying to kill each other with words! They all wanted to get paid with different items, so I said, why don\u2019t we get paid in gift certificates to Old Navy, and then whenever we want to, we can go to Old Navy and buy birds and mules and eels from the children\u2019s section.", "Ringo\u2019s idea of getting paid in Old Navy gift certificates wasn\u2019t a terrible idea, but unfortunately I was boycotting Old Navy because none of the onesies in their baby department fit me.

So we had to scrap Ringo\u2019s idea and keep fighting.", " I wanted to spank the Bug Boys to make them behave, but I knew that would have made my drums jealous and they would act out by doing graffiti and killing people.", "The band was quite dysfunctional at this point.", " This is why I don\u2019t agree with people who blame The Beatles\u2019 breakup on Yoko Ono. There were much bigger problems than Yoko, and they existed long before she showed up in the studio.", "The whole band actually really liked Yoko. The only problem was that she had this cardboard box that she forced us to guard while we were recording, and that led to some difficulties.", " One day, Yoko shows up to a recording session with a cardboard box.

It was a chicken restaurant where the waiter would bring you a whole roasted chicken and then crawl under the table and use a lacrosse stick to jostle your chicken around so it looked like it was still alive.

Your chicken is still alive and that\u2019s why it\u2019s jiggling around!\u201d Then the chef hands you a hammer and nails, and you nail your jiggling rotisserie chicken to the table, thus killing it once and for all. Then you tell the chef, \u201cThe chicken is dead,\u201d and the chef says, \u201cWe have to be sure,\u201d so he rips the chicken off the table, takes it into the parking lot, and runs it over with his car. Then the customer gets to eat the chicken off the ground right there in the parking lot. Fidget Chickies is better than normal chicken restaurants because at other chicken restaurants you don\u2019t get to kill your own chicken or eat it off the ground in the parking lot.\u00a0", " Fidget Chickies sounded like the most amazing restaurant in the world.

Stop it, Yoko!\u201d And Yoko was like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m allowed to do whatever I want because I\u2019m married to John Leland.\u201d And she kept pushing the box toward Paul while he was recording his amazing restaurant song.", " Yoko pushed her box toward me while I was in the middle of recording, and the top of the box flew open and a long human arm came out of the box and slapped me in the face. Then the human arm went back into the box and closed the lid. I opened up the box to yell at the arm, but there was nothing inside the box but a dead crow.", " It completely spoiled the take. It was heartbreaking.", " I said to Paul, \u201cDo you think you could record your restaurant idea again?\u201d And Paul said, \u201cNo, I need to go to sleep on the floor now,\u201d and then he went to sleep on the floor. So we had to scrap the whole song. We were all devastated.", " Yoko Ono is the reason why Fidget Chickies doesn\u2019t exist.", "After that we said to John, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry.

Sadly, the second we stopped playing, all the animals started eating each other. Bears were eating deer, mice were eating the bears, a fox chewed off his own leg while the rest of him got eaten by an iguana, the deer were eating each other while the iguanas tore the bears to pieces, and this all went on for about 20 minutes, and then a gorilla walked into the studio already in the middle of eating a raccoon, and then the mice and leopards teamed up to eat the gorilla and the gorilla kept eating the raccoon while getting eaten by the mice and leopards.

Having the good sense to realize that he couldn\u2019t just go from zero to 60 and spring for the fancy $32 tongs endorsed by Rachael Ray, he instead opted to buy an $8 set from a more generic-seeming brand called Modern Cook that still looked pretty respectable and, with genuine metal grips, probably wouldn\u2019t warp in the dishwasher like his junky IKEA ones.\u00a0", "The former Jeremy would never have even ventured into a Home Goods store\u2014typically, he would find the cheapest possible option for any given item online and purchase it sight unseen, even if multiple reviews mentioned poor quality or a strange smell.

One night last week, I was struggling for a good half hour in the yard trying to safely start a bonfire while my stepsons looked on and berated me with emasculating comments about my shortcomings as a man and a provider. Humiliated and desperate to prove them wrong, I momentarily let my judgement slip and decided to pour a can of gas over the starter log, instantly producing a towering inferno that incinerated all the lower branches on my beloved maple tree.

This turned out to be a brilliant move on my behalf, as I became the star of yet another viral TikTok video that my stepsons filmed, this one titled \u201cFire Loser Can\u2019t Even Kill Himself Correctly\u201d. Though my stepsons couldn\u2019t make it to the hospital to visit me this time because they were busy playing video games, and neither could my wife because she\u2019s no longer speaking to me, I know deep down that they all love and respect me more than ever.

He explained that this is problematic because Don, Jr. is \u201c250 pounds heavier than Eric,\u201d so he gets a worse workout if he accidentally practices the Heimlich maneuver on Eric instead of Don, Jr., and it is therefore absolutely critical that he summons the correct son.

The race to Mars is officially over!", "As confirmed by footage from NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover, Reggie Lindahl, a 46-year-old resident of Utica, New York, just officially became the first person to land on Mars. Neighbors of Lindahl confirmed that he was cleaning some leaves off his driveway yesterday afternoon when he accidentally pointed his Dewalt handheld leaf blower straight at the ground and was immediately rocketed up into the sky. Although Reggie seemed surprised by his sudden takeoff, at first screaming \u201cHelp!\u201d as he flailed helplessly through the air, once he passed the tree line he actually seemed to be enjoying himself, shouting \u201cWoo! I can fly! Let\u2019s take this thing to space, baby!\u201d before cranking up the power on the leaf blower and aiming himself towards the cosmos.\u00a0\u00a0", "Local air traffic control became aware of the situation after Lindahl crossed into regulation airspace, and they then alerted NASA to the rogue astronaut\u2019s presence just in time for researchers on the International Space Station to look out the window and see him soaring past with a big smile on his face, yelling \u201cI\u2019M FLYING THROUGH OUTER SPACE! I\u2019M A FUCKING GOD!\u201d At this point, sources confirm that officials at both NASA and SpaceX began to worry that Lindahl might beat them to the Red Planet, which is exactly what he did earlier today. Footage taken by the Curiosity rover shows Lindahl wildly crash-landing on Mars this morning at 6:31 EST, after which he staggered to his feet, looked around confusedly, and shouted, \u201cWhere the heck am I? The freaking moon?\u201d He then pumped his fists in celebration and cried out \u201cReggie\u2019s on the moon, baby!\u201d before joyously pounding back the contents of a flask he\u2019d produced from the back pocket of his blue jeans.\u00a0\u00a0", "Wow!

I\u2019m a freakin\u2019 NBA player!\u201d over and over until he eventually landed awkwardly and twisted his ankle, at which point he writhed on the ground in pain for several minutes before getting tuckered out and falling asleep.\u00a0", "The news of Lindahl\u2019s landing comes as a huge blow to NASA and SpaceX, who both had invested incredible sums of money into the race to send the first manned mission to Mars. While there\u2019s no word yet on whether these space agencies will move forward with their Mars missions or pivot to different pursuits, it\u2019s safe to say that Lindahl has definitely thrown a wrench into their plans.", "At press time, Lindahl had yet to start up his leaf blower again to begin the long journey back to Earth, but once he returns, there\u2019s no question he\u2019ll receive a hero\u2019s welcome for pulling off such a historic feat.

Once this training is complete, customers can expect to crawl into their local Starbucks and sidle up to the enormous coffee receptacle to enjoy their morning cup of joe while feeling good about leaving a cleaner planet for our children.", "Wow, this is awesome!

First, he almost immediately lost the remote because that\u2019s what happens when you keep a remote in the kitchen, and so the only way to turn the TV on was to reach around to the back and feel around for the buttons. Then it turned out that the tiny TV couldn\u2019t even get cable because Comcast started charging per box, and there was no fucking way Dad was about to shell out extra for that. But what really made the TV useless was the fact that you could easily see the much larger living room TV perfectly from the kitchen table. Dad nonetheless tried his best to convince himself the TV was a worthwhile purchase, occasionally turning it on for background noise while he read ", "Zits ", "comics and Rick Reilly articles at the kitchen table. But his opinion of the TV soured over time, as by 2009 the tiny Vizio was already looking dated as shit\u2014just weirdly thick and plastic-y, like a laptop the Army would use in a movie. With each passing year it looked dumber and dumber on the counter, and Dad\u2019s resentment grew. He tried pitching it as \u201cperfect for a dorm\u201d every time one of the kids went off to college, but no one ever bit. It\u2019s the first thing he screams at whenever he tees off on \u201ccounter clutter\u201d while agitatedly making a sandwich, and it will likely remain so for the rest of time, as Dad could never bring himself to get rid of something that he spent more than $20 on.", "If you figured a household item had to be broken or outdated to make it onto Dad\u2019s shit list, his longstanding grudge against the Bowflex puts that theory to bed. The guy bought the insane-looking, Dr. Octopus-ass piece of workout equipment in 2003 during one of his little phases where he decided he was going to get in shape, but it didn\u2019t take long for the relationship to sour. After only a few weeks of getting sweaty as shit while doing half-assed 15-minute Bowflex workouts, Dad had clearly given up on exercising regularly but was too proud to admit it, so he instead started blaming the machine for his lack of follow-through. Whether it was 100 percent fabricated complaints like \u201cCable workouts are bad for my rotator cuff, and Bowflex is all cables,\u201d or definitely-not-scientific bullshit that he thinks sounds smart like \u201cThe Bowflex is fine in a pinch, but you can\u2019t build any real muscle mass without free weights,\u201d or dumb attempts to paint himself as a victim like \u201cBowflex was as big a scam as the Shake Weight, I should get my money back,\u201d Dad was constantly trying to prove that him being a fat, lazy piece of shit was somehow the Bowflex\u2019s fault. He eventually made a big dramatic show of dragging the Bowflex into the unfinished storage room in the basement so that he didn\u2019t have to look at it anymore.

It\u2019s something that Dad is constantly getting pissy over, as Grandpa is usually parked in the best recliner and watching something that isn\u2019t the thing Dad wants to watch. If Mom didn\u2019t care about Grandpa so much, Dad definitely would\u2019ve ditched him at a nursing home years ago, but since that\u2019s not something he\u2019s allowed to do, he\u2019s instead settled on just constantly bitching at Grandpa and acting like he\u2019s holding him back from living his best life, even though he was doing literally nothing notable with his time before Grandpa moved in and his lifestyle has not changed in any discernible way since.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having outdoor patio furniture if you can\u2019t even keep it outside?

Even more frustrating for him is the fact that the cushions are gigantic and there\u2019s no place to discreetly store them, so they usually just end up stacked in a pile that takes up half the kitchen and makes it impossible for him to do his daily sudoku puzzle at the kitchen table without getting all riled up about how much of an eyesore it is. Dad once threw such a big tantrum over the patio chairs that it made Mom cry, which is definitely shitty but also kind of funny if you think about it. ", "For as long as the family has lived in this house, Dad has waxed poetic about finishing the basement, a pipedream he believed would transform the standard, concrete cellar littered with cardboard boxes and fake-leather furniture into a source of endless joy and would boost the house\u2019s resale value by \u201ca hundred grand, easy.\u201d And in 2007, Dad finally embarked on his journey to make that dream a reality, and he couldn\u2019t have been more thrilled. He had drywall put up and painted. He bought a ping-pong table and a corresponding little stand where the paddles and balls would go. He even hung up the several vintage beer lights he\u2019d collected and saved for this exact occasion, prominently featuring them as the centerpieces of his grown-ass-man-who-still-thinks-frat-house-decor-looks-cool design scheme.\u00a0", "Unfortunately, though, his efforts were derailed when Grandma on Mom\u2019s side died and he suddenly had to devote all his Saturdays to getting rid of all her old-lady junk and selling her house, putting a temporary pause on the remodel that eventually just turned into a permanent one, leaving the half-finished basement looking incredibly shitty. The air hockey table Dad was once so proud to have scooped off eBay for $75 quickly became a laundry folding station. Ping-pong paddles got strewn about everywhere, the rubber padding on them chewed up by the dog. The vintage wet bar he inherited when Grandma on ", "his ", "side died was left looking weird and out of place against the dusty concrete floors, failing to deliver the classy Don Draper-style effect he was aiming for. Plus, it\u2019s absolutely goddamn freezing down there, and at this point the only time anyone ever goes to the basement is to use the bathroom Dad paid out the ass to have put in, as this is the one place in the house you can go to take mondo nasty shits in peace.\u00a0", "Because of all this, Dad now hates the basement more than maybe anything else in the world. If he has to go down there even to grab something real quick, you\u2019ll actually see the muscles in his face tense and shift into a scowl, and it\u2019s hard to blame him. In his head, the basement betrayed him. It betrayed the future they were supposed to have together, in which it would provide a nightly escape from all the stresses of being up on the main floor with Mom, who, to his credit, is really annoying. For a guy who has literally nothing interesting or important going on in his life, a finished basement would\u2019ve provided him with the illusion that he\u2019d done something worthwhile with his time on Earth, which of course is not the case, but still. The half-finished basement now stands as a metaphor for Dad himself\u2014a monument to the unremarkable and to failing to live up to potential\u2014and his disdain for it is clearly just a projection of his own low self-esteem. It\u2019s really pitiful, to be honest. Dad is a pitiful man.\u00a0"]},

My costar started thrusting his hard cock into the void between my legs while someone off set loudly plunged a toilet to mimic the sound of wet vaginal friction, and while it definitely felt a little awkward, after about 12 minutes we both managed to cum without his penis ever once touching my body.

The first setting he tried produced a single concentrated stream of water that kind of just blasted him on the back of the neck while leaving the rest of his body cold and sudsy, while the second just sputtered out a mess of atomized bullshit, issuing a fine dew that barely even got him wet and offered absolutely nothing in terms of utility.\u00a0", "Though the first two settings were unmitigated disasters that in no way resembled what a normal person would consider a shower, Max foolishly continued with the doomed experiment, cycling through a so-called massage setting that utterly failed to live up to the promise of its name thanks to his apartment\u2019s subpar water pressure, followed by a 10-second tryst with \u201cWIDE,\u201d a maddeningly unspecific setting that sprayed a circle of water around but not onto his body, achieving nothing. His gamble was clearly not paying off, but he nonetheless then went on to try the \u201cPULSE\u201d setting, which was just like the normal setting but with constant interruptions, leaving him yearning for the simple, reliable consistency of the original setting, which he finally ended up sheepishly returning to, having made an ass of himself.\u00a0", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Bet you\u2019re feeling like quite the dipshit now, aren\u2019t you, Max?", "This all just goes to show that trying new things is never worth it. Let this pitiful saga serve as a cautionary tale for all those who might delude themselves into thinking that there\u2019s a better way to do things, when there almost certainly never is. Just be a normal person and stick to the normal shower head setting. It\u2019s not hard."]},

I\u2019ll jab you right in the leg! Try me!\u201d In the tech industry, people were ready to hear that kind of message.\u00a0", "My goal was to disrupt blood testing. Getting your blood drawn is one of the most traumatic experiences a person can go through \u2014 it involves leaving your house, it can take up to several minutes, and the whole thing has to be interpreted for you by someone who went to school specifically to learn how to do that. It\u2019s a broken system. I envisioned another way: a way where people who wanted blood tests could put their hands inside a box and let the box figure it out.", "Elizabeth first approached me with her idea for a biotech company when she was still in school. The first thing I noticed about her was her switchblade. She whipped this tiny little knife out of her pocket as soon as she got into my office, and she started poking it around at the air, yelling \u201cYou\u2019re gonna help me with my blood company and you\u2019re gonna like it! Or I\u2019m gonna getcha! You bet your ass I\u2019m gonna getcha!\u201d Then, she launched into her pitch for a business called \u201cTheranos\u201d \u2014\u00a0 a portmanteau of \u201cTheraflu\u201d and \u201cDomino\u2019s\u201d. All in all, she seemed determined to succeed, but I was turned off by her lack of expertise with the subject. She seemed to have an incredibly poor understanding of basic biology.", "I want to be clear about one thing: I have no idea what\u2019s inside of blood. I never did. But succeeding in Silicon Valley isn\u2019t about knowing what blood is. It\u2019s about making a billion dollars.", "I became even more disturbed after I saw her transcript. She was only in two classes, one of which was a one-credit course called \u201cCopying Keys 101.\u201d That class just covered how to make copies of house keys, like those guys behind the booth at Home Depot do. The other was \u201cRemedial American History For Complete Idiots.\u201d None of that made me feel confident that she knew what she was doing, medicine-wise.", "I saw Phyllis Gardner at a Stanford staff event and she told me about Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 idea. I personally thought it was genius. I\u2019ve always wished there was a way to get your blood drawn by someone or something other than a trained professional, in someplace other than a sterile, fully equipped doctor\u2019s office. There were many other people who agreed with me.", "When I met Elizabeth, I could instantly tell she had something special. She was totally fearless, just dancing around my office with her switchblade and saying \u201cIt\u2019s a blood company, idiot!! What don\u2019t you understand about that? Give me a million bucks before I slice your little dick off!\u201d She wouldn\u2019t stop waving her knife in my face until I said I was in. I found that really impressive.", "You don\u2019t see a lot of young women in Silicon Valley who are willing to back you up against the wall behind your desk with this blade to your throat and say, \u201cListen, mister: I need your money to make a big blood box and I need it yesterday. Capitulate now, or there will be hell to pay!\u201d On some level, I just wanted to see someone like that succeed. I thought to myself, \u201cThis woman could be the next Steve Jobs.\u201d", "Steve Jobs embodied everything I have always wanted to be: 6\u20192, bald, best friends with Steve Wozniak, and the owner of a company that sells expensive rectangles that make everyone\u2019s life more convenient and worse at the same time. There was no question: What Steve Jobs did for iMovie, I wanted to do for blood.", ": It was clear to me that Elizabeth was obsessed with becoming a tech superstar, and I could tell that she was manipulating her public image to make people respect her more. For example, in the media and at work she talks in this deep, authoritative baritone, but I\u2019ve heard her real voice, and it\u2019s actually much, much deeper.", ": Ever since she was a little kid, Elizabeth has had a voice like a distant airplane taking off. It\u2019s normally well below the range of human hearing \u2014 when she opens her mouth, you can see her forming words, and you can feel the floor shaking, but you have to strain to understand any of what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s a shame, but I think she felt that if she was going to succeed as a woman in Silicon Valley, she needed to make her voice more palatable to the general public.", " Elizabeth clearly believed that no one would take her seriously if they could feel their legs trembling from the bass in her voice before they could even understand what she was trying to tell them. It must have been difficult to keep up, but she raised her voice several octaves every time she spoke publicly, and it seems like it really worked.", ": People were going crazy for Elizabeth. She was making all kinds of media lists: Time\u2019s 30 Tech Geniuses Under 30, Glamour\u2019s 500 Female Entrepreneurs Under 90, Fortune\u2019s 12 CEOs Who Look About 25, Forbes\u2019 prestigious Two Ladies We Saw At The Mall Yesterday Who Seem Like They Might Be Up To Something.

What was Theranos? Can someone tell me?", "The Theranos board meetings were a bit of a mixed bag. The Theranos headquarters was this huge, ultra-modern building with all-white furniture and inspirational quotes on the walls that said things like, \u201cPlease Succeed Today,\u201d and \u201cBlood. Excellence. Theranos. Repeat.\u201d But if anyone asked Elizabeth if they could see any of the technology they were working on, she would yell \u201cTrade secret!\u201d and hit them over the head with a big club. She called that \u201cwiping their memory.\u201d And then, of course, there was always Henry Kissinger standing in the corner of the room with a bunch of balloons that said \u201cHappy Birthday, Beautiful!\u201d", " If it was my niece\u2019s birthday party, I hope she had a nice time.", "I accepted a job as a lab assistant at Theranos in 2005 because I thought I was getting in on the ground floor of something incredible. A lot of us felt that way \u2014 like we were going to be changing the world alongside Silicon Valley\u2019s next big freak of nature.", "I worked at Apple under Steve Jobs for fifteen years, so I was used to being part of a demanding work environment by the time I was hired at Theranos. But", "I could tell something was off from the get-go when Elizabeth handed me a portable karaoke machine and said \u201cYou need to figure out how to turn this into a doctor.\u201d", "Every day we were supposed to work on this blood testing machine that Elizabeth wanted to call \u201cDr. Holmes\u2019 Blood Blaster 5000,\u201d but which was eventually shortened to \u201cThe Edison.\u201d It was supposed to be a compact, streamlined box that could perform hundreds of diagnostic blood tests instantly \u2014 but all we had to start with was a Sony brand karaoke machine with multicolor strobe lights on the front and a big, heavy microphone hanging off the side.", "The easiest way to become a billionaire is to sell something in the shape of a box. Walkman? Box. Computer? Box. iPod? Box. People want to see a bunch of wires in a box. And that\u2019s what I was going to give them.", "Elizabeth had clearly just gotten this karaoke machine from a Circuit City. There was still a receipt stuck to it. But she told us that this was the prototype for the Edison, and that she wanted people to be able to stick their hands inside it and immediately find out how they were going to die. I thought that sounded impossible, but we had to try. When you spoke to Elizabeth, she had a way of making you believe in her vision.", "We pretty quickly figured out a way that we could get the karaoke machine to play \u201cAin\u2019t No Other Man\u201d by Christina Aguilera. We would have test subjects come in and sing along to Ain\u2019t No Other Man, and then we would try to decide if they had a disease or not based on how well they did. As a scientist, it was not a diagnostic method I felt good about using, but it was the best we could do at the time.", "The next iteration of the Edison was great at some things, but not at others. We got to a point where our machine could prick someone\u2019s finger for a blood sample, but we couldn\u2019t figure out how to test the blood. All we could do was create a flawless, sentient clone of that person. So then we had at least a hundred clones running around that we had to lock up in the boiler room. We put up a volleyball net for them, so for a while they had a pretty good time, but eventually they started clawing at the walls and trying to escape. All the desperate scratching sounds made the work environment at Theranos that much more unpleasant.", ": I\u2019m pretty sure those clones all got let out when the company shut down. I hope they\u2019re doing all right, wherever they are. None of them have Social Security numbers.", "The last Edison machine we came up with was just a toaster. We figured if we couldn\u2019t give people a blood test, it would be nice if they at least had some toast.", "We were beginning to realize that the technology Elizabeth was asking for wasn\u2019t going to be possible, but she refused to take no for an answer. One time, she made me stick my hand in the toaster, turned it on, and when I pulled it out all red and burnt she said \u201cSee? It works. You have lupus.\u201d But as mean as she was, things got ten times worse when she hired Sunny Balwani as Theranos\u2019s president.", "Beginning in 2009, Sunny was my right-hand man and the head of day-to-day operations at Theranos. Yes, we did have a romantic relationship, but we never brought that into the workplace. We kissed on the lips, sure, but that\u2019s what I would have done with any president of the company, as a show of respect.", "I first met Elizabeth when I was driving down University Avenue in Palo Alto, and she was on the sidewalk, dragging a burlap sack full of hundred dollar bills behind her. She was the most perfect woman I had ever laid eyes on. I yelled \u201cHey lady! What\u2019s the cash for?\u201d and she yelled back \u201cTheranos stuff!\u201d It was the start of an incredible relationship.", "Once Elizabeth and Sunny got together, there was no chance of getting through to them. If you went to raise a concern, they would just stand there giving each other peck after peck on the lips until you backed down. They insisted they weren\u2019t dating, and that it was a classic Silicon Valley custom between a company\u2019s president and CEO.", "We all had to gather every morning in the cafeteria for a \u201cLeaders\u2019 Kiss\u201d ceremony, where Elizabeth and Sunny would hold hands and kiss each other on the lips while all the employees chanted \u201cThis is normal! This is normal!\u201d It was their way of lording their power over us.", "I just couldn\u2019t stay away from Elizabeth. She was everything I had ever wanted in a woman: she hated getting her blood drawn, she dressed kind of like Steve Jobs, and she could make a copy of your house keys in under an hour. We were an unstoppable team.", "I started dreading going to work every morning. One time, Elizabeth and Sunny called me into their shared office to formally reprimand me, because they said my desk wasn\u2019t clean enough for them to make out on top of. I had to stay late Lysoling it down.\u00a0", "One time I asked Elizabeth if she could quit spritzing cologne onto Sunny\u2019s neck and come take a look at this robotic arm I was working on for the Edison, but she just turned to me, sprayed the cologne right in my eyes and screamed, \u201cIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, asshole! Mind your own business!\u201d It was the middle of June, but I was too afraid to argue with her.\u00a0", "When investors came by the lab to check up on our operations and try out the Edison machines, Elizabeth and Sunny made us turn out all the lights, lay down on the floor, and pretend we were asleep. Sometimes it would take hours before the visiting investors gave up and went away. Things were going downhill fast, but all of us wanted to believe that they could still turn around.", "It was my dream to put an Edison machine in every Pacsun in America. I wanted to make taking charge of your health as easy as giving a single finger prick of blood right after you finish paying for a pair of light wash bootcut jeans and a zip-up sweatshirt with the Billabong logo on it. But Pacsun wasn\u2019t interested, so we moved on to our plan B: Walgreens.", "When Elizabeth Holmes approached me about putting Edison machines in Walgreens, I agreed immediately. I\u2019m always looking to put more junk in the back of a Walgreens. We\u2019ve already got those shitty old blood pressure machines that only kids who are waiting for their parents to be done at the pharmacy ever use, plus those weird, dirty-looking shelves full of on-sale diet pills and off-brand Easter candy and whatnot, so I figured, why not add whatever the hell this woman is talking about?", "One of the highlights of our marketing campaign was when I got the chance to film a Theranos commercial with the great Errol \u201cYou Can Bet Your Ass He\u2019s Showbiz\u2019s Finest Errol\u201d Morris.", "A lot of people ask me, \u201cErrol, why did you agree to make a commercial for Theranos? What were you thinking? Didn\u2019t you make \u201cThe Thin Blue Line\u201d? Aren\u2019t you tirelessly committed to justice and truth-telling? Couldn\u2019t you tell Elizabeth Holmes was a fraud?\u201d I tell those people, \u201cDo you know who I am? I\u2019m Errol freaking Morris, okay? ", "I ", "ask ", "you ", "the questions. ", "I ", "make a documentary about ", "you. I ", "figure out why ", "you ", "made a commercial for Theranos, not the other way around. Capisce?\u201d And by the time I\u2019m done saying all that, they\u2019ve usually walked away.", "The Walgreens deal was the last straw for me. It was incredibly dishonest. We all knew that the Edison was a disaster. Almost everyone who used it, regardless of age or sex, got told that they were pregnant, and also had rubella.", "There were literally thousands of people out on the street every day, screaming in horror and tearing out their hair because they thought they were going to die of rubella in the middle of their unwanted pregnancies. It was not right that we put people through that.", "After the Walgreens rollout, Sunny forced me to hire my 12-year-old cousin to ferry all the blood samples from the Edison machines at Walgreens to nearby commercial labs that could process them. He and Elizabeth would do anything to cover up the fact that the Edison didn\u2019t work.", "I was so excited to take my first Theranos test at the drugstore, because normally I hate getting my blood drawn. But the test turned out to be a major disappointment. First of all, as soon as I walked up to the Edison machine, I could see a man in full camouflage crouching right behind it. I figured that was a fluke, so I tried to just ignore him while I stuck my hand inside and let the machine prick my finger. But then, a second later, I saw the man grab a tiny vial of my blood from the machine and furiously army crawl out the back door of the Walgreens. I followed him, and from the door he tossed the vial to this little boy in a bucket hat who was sitting on a BMX bike in the back parking lot. As soon as the kid caught the vial, he started pedaling like hell up the street \u2014 I assume to take my blood to some kind of lab. Later that night, the test results came back saying that I was already dead. That wasn\u2019t really what I was looking for from the Theranos experience.", "I had been following the Theranos story with a level of skepticism for years, but it was 2015 when the company started to seem really shady to me. That was when I brought my telescope up to the roof of a hair salon across the street from their lab and started seeing for myself what was going on behind closed doors.\u00a0", "Yeah, I let that reporter guy use my roof to spy on Theranos. I don\u2019t like that place. I used their machine and it told me my blood \u201csmelled wrong.\u201d I don\u2019t let anyone say that kind of thing to me, especially at my own neighborhood Walgreens.", "Once I climbed on top of Fantasy Cuts and trained my telescopic lens on the Theranos building, all my suspicions were confirmed: I was instantly able to spot Elizabeth and Sunny Balwani running towards each other from opposite ends of a room with their lips all puckered like they were going to kiss each other, then accidentally bashing their heads together and spinning around a bunch before collapsing on the floor. I realized that they were putting on a competent face for the public, but had no idea what they were doing.", "It seemed like a few people were catching on to what was going on inside Theranos, but at the same time, the general public was still obsessed with her. In 2015, President Obama even made Elizabeth one of his administration\u2019s Presidential Ambassadors For Global Entrepreneurship and invited her to the White House. And Vice President Biden flew out to tour the Theranos facility.", "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I have never invited Elizabeth Holmes anywhere. Michelle must have snuck into my office and done that. Michelle loves Theranos. Not me. I think Theranos is stupid.", "Everyone is so mad at me for visiting Theranos, but the truth is, I saw some incredible things there. They had this room full of vials, beakers, little dropper things, machines everywhere \u2014 I think they called it a \u201cscience laboratory.\u201d I don\u2019t know how they thought that up, but in my opinion, it was genius.", "Soon, I began speaking anonymously to some Theranos employees about what was going on at the company. I would stand on the roof of Fantasy Cuts waving furiously until I caught someone\u2019s attention through the Theranos window. Then I would signal for them to come over to the salon, and while Vicky gave them a bowl cut, I\u2019d ask them some questions.", "The bowl is the only hair shape that\u2019s universally flattering. I give all my clients bowl cuts, unless they\u2019re bald, in which case I put a wig on them.", "I was really happy that John Carreyrou was trying to report the truth about Theranos, but it was scary to be a whistleblower because you always came back with the telltale bowl cut. Fortunately, enough of us got them that it just became a trend in its own right, and even people who weren\u2019t talking to John were showing up to work with round, floppy hairdos.\u00a0", "I gotta say, John interviewed a lot of those Theranos employees in front of me while I was giving them bowl cuts, and honestly the company didn\u2019t sound so bad. The bosses were always kissing, which I think is cute.", "After speaking with a few employees, I knew I had a bombshell story on my hands. It was time for me to pack up my telescope, bring it home, remove any dirt and debris using a microfiber cloth, pack it up again, store it safely in my attic, lock the door to my attic, call my brother over to my house to double check that I locked the attic properly, make dinner for my brother to thank him for helping me with the attic thing, eat dinner with my brother, wash the dishes, walk my brother out to his car, come back inside, and get writing.", "Public opinion about Theranos finally started to shift after John Carreyrou\u2019s stories came out. You would be at a newstand and see a Wired magazine with a cover story called \u201cElizabeth Holmes Is The Albert Einstein Of Blood,\u201d but right next to it would be the WSJ with a front page story called \u201cElizabeth Holmes Is The Cal Ripken, Jr. Of Blood.\u201d To understand that one, you had to know that John Carreyrou thinks Cal Ripken, Jr. is an idiot. Once people caught on, it was all over.", "The morning my first Theranos story came out, I woke up to my phone ringing off the hook. It was my dentist\u2019s office calling to remind me that I had a 9:30 a.m. appointment scheduled the following Wednesday. It would have been nice if they had mentioned my big article, but I guess they hadn\u2019t seen it yet.", "I\u2019ve been a Theranos skeptic from the start, so I wasn\u2019t surprised at all when Elizabeth and Sunny were finally exposed. In fact, when the news broke, I was already halfway done cross-stitching my decorative \u201cElizabeth Holmes And Sunny Balwani Will Soon Face Criminal Fraud Charges For Their Terrible, Terrible Lies\u201d pillow.\u00a0", "I got the news that Theranos was done when I was at the lab, in the middle of trying to get the Edison to stop flashing \u201cI DON\u2019T LIKE YOU\u201d on its screen anytime a patient would give a blood sample. I knocked the Edison over and sprinted out of the office, straight to my house. I was excited to put the Theranos chapter behind me.", "I was relieved when I heard the company was finally shutting down, but unfortunately, it can be hard to get a new job in Silicon Valley when you have Theranos on your resum\u00e9. I understand that I look silly for ever having believed in Elizabeth Holmes. But if you had ever witnessed her in action, running around you in tighter and tighter circles while rapid-fire jabbing that switchblade into the air in front of her, you might understand. She was a truly mesmerizing figure.", "There were times when I was watching Elizabeth and Sunny doing a sexually suggestive tango across the Theranos cafeteria and I would just be praying that somehow, some way, they would stop mid-backbend, turn around to face me, and say \u201cWe\u2019ve got a plan. We\u2019ve got a way to make Theranos work.\u201d It never happened, though. There was a lot of wishful thinking that went on at that company.", "John Carreyrou calling me the Cal Ripken, Jr. of blood was a double-edged sword \u2014 I knew he meant it as a pejorative, but Cal Ripken, Jr. is also one of the baldest men in baseball, which I admire. What was really difficult was when the law started coming after me, all because some people didn\u2019t like what my machines were saying about their blood.", "I will tell you the same thing I told the SEC, the FBI, and everyone else who has asked me: my beautiful Elizabeth and I did nothing wrong. We were in love, and sometimes falling in love means defrauding hundreds of people to help keep your girlfriend\u2019s biotech business afloat. If ", "loving someone so much that you commit crimes on their behalf is a crime, then lock me up and throw away the key.", "I\u2019ll get a lot of criticism for this, but I stand by my investment in Theranos and I always will. Elizabeth was the only person in the world with the vision and the foresight to realize that sometimes you don\u2019t want accurate health data \u2014 you want health data from a box that has a needle inside of it. Someday, that idea will prevail.", "Maybe Theranos was a lovely party for my great-niece. She is turning 28 this year. She is a wonderful young woman.", "The media and the government took some big swings against me. They\u2019re intent on ruining my business prospects, but I won\u2019t let them keep me down. I already have a new idea for a compact, easy-to-use machine that takes a picture of your eye and analyzes the picture to tell you how old you are. It can get within 6 years of your exact age 85% of the time. The working name is the \u201cDr. Holmes Eye Blaster 5000.\u201d\u00a0", "By 2022, there will be a Dr. Holmes Eye Blaster 5000 in every home in America. Mark my words.", "The bottom line is, you can\u2019t trust everything that people are saying about me. Silicon Valley is all about risk, and that\u2019s exactly what Theranos was. When I started the company, I still had some things to learn about medicine. Did I know what ingredients God uses to make blood red? No. Did I know the names of all five veins in the human body? No. Did I know why people hate dying so much? No. I didn\u2019t know any of that. What I knew is that I had a vision. And I still do.", "It can be hard to make sense of how Theranos got as far as it did before collapsing in on itself. There are a lot of explanations you could give for what happened. Maybe it was a one-in-a-million fluke. Maybe it was the power of Elizabeth\u2019s switchblade. Maybe it was all a fanciful dream playing out in the head of a slumbering giant in a faraway cave, and none of us exist at all. It\u2019s hard to say. In the end, I think everyone just wanted to believe that a deranged woman with an unhinged lust for a billion dollars could change the healthcare industry forever. I guess we were all wrong."]},

It must be so hard to have your life upended like this.", "Rachel has since filed for divorce, but she admits that the split hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cThe rug has been completely pulled out from under me,\u201d Rachel explained. \u201cEvery morning, he would pack up a knapsack full of ropes, swords, compasses \u2013 all types of pirate stuff \u2013 and head out for the day. I thought he was spending it aboard the Jolly Roger beside Captain Hook, but it turns out he was just at an accounting firm.\u201d", "\u201cI spent 20 years thinking I was in love with a man who was second in command to the world\u2019s greatest pirate, only to learn that he\u2019d never even met him,\u201d Rachel lamented. \u201cIt just goes to show that even if someone wears a red cap and blue striped shirt like Mr. Smee and bumbles around like Mr. Smee, it still might not be the real Mr. Smee.\u201d", "Just tragic.

Though Anya says she was at the end of her rope in terms of dealing with mental stress before making these lifestyle changes, it\u2019s difficult to believe that what she was going through was any more awful than the way she lives now, which involves \u201cenjoying a seltzer at dinner to satisfy [my] cravings for a fun drink.\u201d\u00a0", "Sorry, Anya, but this is honestly way fucking sadder than just feeling bad all the time.", "Anya went on to write that she also strictly avoids dairy and gluten and spends 30 minutes each day in silent meditation, as if that kind of exhausting, hellish lifestyle is any more appealing than just gritting your teeth through the pain of living with mental health issues. Perhaps worst of all, her \u201cgratitude practice\u201d involves writing a full letter to someone important in her life every single week\u2014time that would almost definitely be better spent lying in bed all day, eating an entire family-size bag of chips, or falling asleep on the couch while watching HGTV.\u00a0 According to Anya, food and social media binges increase the stress hormone cortisol, though she failed to point out that dealing with high cortisol is probably a lot more fun and manageable than living the life of some sort of ascetic monk day in and day out for the rest of your existence.", "We appreciate that Anya was trying to use her platform to promote mental wellness, but her ideas are honestly terrible. You have to assume that anyone who adopts the habits Anya has will end up about a hundred times more depressed than they were before. If you\u2019re desperate for a mental health fix, maybe try it, but it seems like the cost on this one is really going to outweigh the benefit. Thanks, but no thanks, Anya."]},

{"headline": [], "article": ["I am strong and brave and that is why I get sued all the time by everyone. One of the things that loves to sue me is the Walt Disney Corporation. The reason why they sue me is because I own a business where I dress up as Mickey Mouse and eat locusts in front of children at birthday parties. Disney says that this is a flagrant copyright violation, and whenever they find out that I\u2019ve once again put on my Mickey Mouse costume to eat bugs in front of children for money, they sue me for everything I\u2019m worth. Here are all the times this has happened.", "My business started out so promising. Here is how it worked. When a child had a birthday party, I would put on my Mickey Mouse costume, stuff about 30,000 locusts into a garbage bag, and drive to the kid\u2019s house. I would knock on the door and all the kids would shout, \u201cMickey Mouse! Hooray!\u201d or some such embarrassing bullshit. Then I would say, \u201cHi, everyone! I heard that someone here is turning eight years old, so Mickey Mouse is going to show you how he eats bugs off the floor!\u201d Then I would dump the locusts on the floor and get on my hands and knees and start stuffing the locusts into my mouth. Since the Mickey Mouse mask didn\u2019t come with an opening, I cut a hole out of one of the eyes and began shoving the locusts through there. To the children, this looked like Mickey Mouse was shoving live locusts into his empty eye socket and then somehow loudly chewing them up somewhere inside his skull. The kids loved this, and they would dance around Mickey Mouse throwing flower petals on him as he crawled on the floor catching locusts and stuffing them into his eyes for sustenance (I made the parents pay for the flower petals). Unfortunately, the Walt Disney Corporation did not share the children\u2019s enthusiasm, and when they found out about it, they sued me for copyright infringement. The trial lasted five minutes, and I ended up owing Disney $30 million. Since I only had $63 in my bank account, I had to pay Disney in locusts.", "But guess what, idiots! Locusts breed like crazy! They are the horniest bugs in God\u2019s filthy kingdom. So in a matter of months I had enough locusts to fill a garbage bag and restart my business. I put my Mickey Mouse costume back on and drove to the nearest birthday party (I found the location using the website AgingChildren.com, which tells you the location of all the children\u2019s birthday parties currently happening within 1,000 miles of your home so that you can bring them a present even if you do not know them). I showed up at the birthday party and all the children screamed idiotic nonsense like, \u201cYay Mickey Mouse!\u201d and I said, \u201cHappy birthday children! Who wants to see Mickey eat his lunch of bugs!\u201d And all the kids said, \u201cMe! Me!\u201d (kids love to watch their favorite cartoon characters eat lunch). And so I dumped my bag of locusts onto the floor and crawled around on the ground eating as many of them as I could. A little girl asked me, \u201cMickey Mouse, where did you get all of those bugs,\u201d and I said to her, \u201cGoofy gave them to me as a housewarming gift after I moved into your grandmother\u2019s tomb.\u201d When the Disney Corporation found out about this, they were not happy. They sued me for \u201cfalsely claiming that the copyrighted character Goofy bought locusts for Mickey Mouse.\u201d They sued me for $30 million, but the only thing I had in my bank account was a $200 gift certificate to a store that sells gym equipment that famous people died on while using. Since I couldn\u2019t pay the legal fees, the court ordered me to surrender all my locusts ", "and ", "my driver\u2019s license. Now I have sprint to all the kids\u2019 birthday parties in my Mickey Mouse costume, which makes me very out of breath. When the children ask me why I\u2019m huffing and puffing, I tell them it\u2019s because I just came from injecting Donald Duck with steroids and he got so muscular that he scared me and made me run away.", "The locusts fucked again, baby! In no time, they\u2019d rapidly reproduced to the point where I once again had enough bugs to reopen my business. Based on the previous lawsuit, it seemed like Disney was mad that I had implied that Goofy was the person giving Mickey Mouse the locusts. So the next time a child asked me, \u201cMickey, where did you get all of those bugs?\u201d instead of saying \u201cGoofy gave me these locusts to eat,\u201d I said, \u201cA talking dog with no name gave me these locusts to eat.\u201d The concept of a nameless talking dog scared some of the kids and they started to cry, so I tried to cheer them up by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, kids! Did you know that all of the locusts Mickey Mouse is eating are also named Mickey Mouse?\u201d This just made the kids cry more, but the little troopers kept throwing flower petals onto Mickey Mouse while he ate his feast of locusts. Sadly, even though I didn\u2019t mention Goofy even once, Disney didn\u2019t care. They sued me anyway. Their legal team said I owed them $30 million for \u201cfalsely claiming that the copyrighted character Mickey Mouse receives insects from a nameless dog. If Mickey Mouse were to receive locusts from a dog, the dog would have a name.\u201d Since I didn\u2019t have any money, the court ordered me to surrender my AgingChildren.com Premium account, so now I have to use AgingChildren.com Basic to find out which kids are having birthdays in my area. AgingChildren.com Basic is worse than Premium because Premium shows you a GPS location of the aging child while Basic puts a cowbell around the aging kid\u2019s neck and makes you follow the sound of the clanging. It takes me a much longer time to find the birthday parties now, but I follow the sound of the bell and I always find the aging child, because I\u2019m a professional locust-eating Mickey Mouse impersonator.", "Since apparently nothing I said involving Goofy was making Disney happy, I thought that it might help me avoid getting sued in the future if I hid behind potted plants at birthday parties so that kids couldn\u2019t see me eating locusts as clearly. So I started doing this, and it seemed to be working well. Kids could hear the loud crunch of me chewing up locusts, but they couldn\u2019t see me behind the potted plants. To prove to them that I really was Mickey Mouse, every now and then I would remove my Mickey Mouse mask and hold it out from behind the plant so that the kids could see Mickey\u2019s head. Unfortunately, the sight of a pair of hands holding up Mickey Mouse\u2019s decapitated head from behind a potted plant didn\u2019t make the kids as excited as I thought it would, and a lot of them started to cry. I tried to cheer the kids up by shouting from behind the potted plant, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, kids! This is Mickey\u2019s empty head, but Mickey\u2019s brain is in a different head, so he can still think about you!\u201d This did not comfort the children. And it didn\u2019t seem to make Disney happy, either, as they once again sued me for $30 million, claiming I\u2019d infringed on their intellectual property and made \u201cslanderous claims about the location of Mickey Mouse\u2019s brain.\u201d Since I only had $32 million in my bank account at the time, this settlement wiped out the vast majority of my savings. Once again, the massive Walt Disney Corporation had crushed the dreams of the little man. All I wanted to do was eat locusts and make children happy\u2014in that specific order\u2014but Disney just wouldn\u2019t allow it.", "Several days later I had an incredible realization: Disney kept suing me because Mickey Mouse is the famous mouse mascot of their company. But what if I created a version of Mickey Mouse that wasn\u2019t a mouse? Disney wouldn\u2019t have a legal leg to stand on! So the next time I showed up at a child\u2019s birthday party in my Mickey Mouse costume and all the kids screamed, \u201cYay! Mickey Mouse!\u201d the first thing I said was, \u201cHere\u2019s something interesting! They did a DNA test on me and I\u2019m 62 percent skunk. I\u2019m far more skunk than mouse. Mickey Mouse is mostly a skunk!\u201d Then I dumped my trash bag of locusts on the ground, got down on all fours, and started eating the locusts off of the ground. The children were quite upset by the news that Mickey Mouse was mostly a skunk, and they all burst into tears while I continued to munch on my locusts. I tried to cheer the kids up by telling them,\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry, kids! Even though I\u2019m mostly a skunk, I don\u2019t spray stinky juice like most skunks! Instead, when I feel threatened, I cough up a pile of foul-smelling sand which I then stuff into my pockets because I think it\u2019s money!\u201d Unfortunately, this only made the children cry harder. To add insult to injury, Disney sued me for $30 million for \u201cmaking salacious claims about the biological origins of Mickey Mouse and falsely declaring Mickey Mouse to be more skunk than mouse.\u201d I\u2019d run out of all my money by that point, so I once again had to pay my legal fees in locusts.", "Since it was apparently illegal for me to claim that Mickey Mouse was the descendant of any particular kind of animal, I decided to alter his origin story to imply that he was not a biological creature at all. So the next time I arrived at a child\u2019s birthday party in my Mickey Mouse costume, I immediately said, \u201cHi, everyone! Mickey Mouse here with an important announcement: I was never born, and no animals are my family! I was born as a result of a mistake involving chemicals that Dr. Robert Oppenheimer made while he was working to develop the atomic bomb! They set off the first-ever atomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and when the mushroom cloud dissipated, Mickey Mouse was standing there. Now it is time for me to eat locusts.\u201d The kids at the birthday party were mostly confused by this announcement. The birthday boy asked me, \u201cMickey, if you aren\u2019t a living animal, then why do you need to eat locusts?\u201d And I replied, \u201cI don\u2019t ", "need", " to eat the locusts. I do it to keep busy.\u201d Another inquisitive little girl asked me, \u201cMickey, does this mean that there is a new Mickey Mouse every time an atomic bomb is detonated,\u201d and I replied, \u201cYes, of course. And when that happens, I travel to the site of the explosion, find the new Mickey Mouse, and strangle him to death.\u201d I had a nice time answering all of the children\u2019s questions about Festive Atomic Mickey Mouse. Unfortunately, Disney once again tracked me down and sued me for $30 million for \u201cmisrepresenting the origins of Mickey Mouse.\u201d Since I didn\u2019t have any money left, the court ruled that I was no longer permitted to wear my Mickey Mouse costume. This hasn\u2019t stopped me from performing as Mickey at children\u2019s birthday parties, though. Now I just open the window and throw the empty costume into the crowd of children and scream from outside, \u201cOh my God! Mickey Mouse is empty! His body is nothing but skin and the wind inside of it!\u201d Sometimes this makes the children upset, and sometimes it makes them cheer and throw flower petals at the empty Mickey Mouse. It\u2019s basically a 50-50 split between children who are sad that Mickey Mouse is nothing but skin and children who are very happy about it. Either way, this is how I plan to make a living until the next time the Walt Disney Company chooses to invent some bullshit reason to sue me."]},

{"headline": [], "article": ["One of the coolest things about Cobweb Lady is that she is often looking at you, even when you don\u2019t know about it! Here are just five of the many, many times that Cobweb Lady was looking at you.", "On the day you were born, Cobweb Lady was looking at you. Cobweb Lady was in the hallway outside your hospital room. She was not allowed to be there, but the doctors didn\u2019t know she was there because the doctors did not know how to see Cobweb Lady. Cobweb Lady saw you before your mother did. She was the first person to know what you looked like. Cobweb Lady had one eye on the hospital bed where you were born, and one eye on the plot of ground far away where you will one day be buried. Your mother held you in her arms and smiled at you. Then, from her hiding place in the hallway Cobweb Lady frowned, and so your mother also frowned, but she didn\u2019t know why. To this day your mother doesn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t blink once on the day you were born. This was just one of the many incredible times that Cobweb Lady was looking at you!", "On the night of your 10th birthday, after you had gone to sleep, Cobweb Lady was looking at you. She stood against the wall opposite your bed and watched you sleep from across the room. It was dark, but that was fine because Cobweb Lady doesn\u2019t use light to see. Cobweb Lady had brought a gift for you. It was a photograph of you holding hands with a tall man whose face was a smile that went the wrong way! She was going to leave the photograph under your floorboards, but while you slept you had a dream that she didn\u2019t like, so she punished you by switching the you in the picture with the you in the bed. You didn\u2019t notice because you were asleep, but to this day, the person you used to be is holding hands with the tall man whose face is a smile that goes the wrong way! It was yet another awesome time that Cobweb Lady was looking at you on your birthday long ago!", "Six days before you were born, Cobweb Lady made a perfect sculpture of you out of paraffin wax. It technically wasn\u2019t the real you, but it was identical to you in every single way. Cobweb Lady stood in the dark and looked at you. Even though it was dark, Cobweb Lady could see you perfectly, and even though it was cold, the wax sculpture of you slowly melted. Cobweb Lady watched without blinking while your wax figure melted and then she walked deeper into the dark. Six days later, your mother gave birth to you and Cobweb Lady was able to find you and look at you for real. Some of the teeth from the sculpture ended up in your mouth!", "There\u2019s a night in your life that you don\u2019t remember when you left your bed and walked into the forest. And guess what? Cobweb Lady was looking at you then! You made your way through the trees, bathed in moonlight that was coming from two directions, and Cobweb Lady looked at you the whole time! You stopped in front of three trees and knelt before each one, and a hand reached out of a hole in each tree and placed a coal-black fruit in your mouth like a priest administering a communion wafer. And Cobweb Lady was looking at you while you ate the coal-black fruit from all three hands at all three trees! Then she watched as your body and your shadow walked in different directions. One of Cobweb Lady\u2019s eyes followed you, and one of Cobweb Lady\u2019s eyes followed your shadow. Only Cobweb Lady was looking at you then, so only she knows how you found your way back home, but Cobweb Lady will never tell you because Cobweb Lady doesn\u2019t tell you things, she only looks at you. This was just one of the many wonderful times that Cobweb Lady was looking at you!", "Cobweb Lady is looking at you right now! Her eyes are bigger than they\u2019ve ever been, and even though she is looking at you from far away, she\u2019s never been closer to you! Physical distance has nothing to do with how close Cobweb Lady is to you. Knowing Cobweb Lady, she\u2019s going to keep looking at you until she\u2019s close enough to reach you. And then you\u2019ll be able to look at Cobweb Lady, too!"]},

This movie is about how Amelia Earhart teaches Dracula to pilot a plane so that he can list \u201cAirplane\u201d as a skill on his resume when he applies for a job as a tour guide at the Statue of Liberty. In the movie, Dracula (played by Regis Phiblin) falls in love with his flight instructor Amelia Earhart (played by German Chancellor Angela Merkel), and in one scene Dracula and Amelia Earhart have sex with each other. Regis has never acted in a sex scene before and he\u2019s very nervous. He has only had sex one time (with his babysitter Rita when he was 50 and she was 62), and he kept his eyes closed the whole time, so he barely knows anything about sex at all. Can you help Regis Philbin emotionally prepare for the first sex scene of his acting career? Take this quiz to find out!"]},
